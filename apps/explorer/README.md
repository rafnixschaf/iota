# Iota Explorer

[Iota Explorer](https://explorer.iota.io/) is a network explorer for the Iota network, similar in functionality to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) or [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/). Use Iota Explorer to see the latest transactions and objects.

# Set Up

**Requirements**: Node 18.0.0 or later.

Dependencies are managed using [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/). You can start by installing dependencies in the root of the Iota repository:

```
$ pnpm install
```

> All `pnpm` commands below are intended to be run in the root of the Iota repo.

## Developing the Iota Explorer

To start the explorer dev server, you can run the following command:

```
pnpm explorer dev
```

This will start the dev server on port 3000, which should be accessible on http://localhost:3000/

## To run end-to-end localnet test

Start validators locally:

```bash
cargo run --bin iota start --force-regenesis --with-faucet
```

In a a separate terminal, you can now run the end-to-end tests:

```bash
pnpm --filter iota-explorer playwright test
```

# Other pnpm commands

### `pnpm explorer build`
