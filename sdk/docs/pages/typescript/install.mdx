# Install Iota TypeScript SDK

The Iota TypeScript SDK is available in the
[Iota monorepo](https://github.com/iotaledger/kinesis/tree/main/sdk) and NPM.

## Install from NPM

To use the Iota TypeScript SDK in your project, run the following command in your project root:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/iota.js
```

## Experimental tag for use with a local Iota network

Projects developing against one of the on-chain Iota networks (Devnet, Testnet, Mainnet) should use
the base SDK published in the NPM registry (previous section) because the code aligns with the
relevant JSON-RPC. If your developing against a
[local network](https://docs.iota.io/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network) built from the
`main` branch of the Iota monorepo, however, you should use the `experimental`-tagged SDK package as
it contains the latest features (or a local build detailed in the section that follows).

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/iota.js@experimental
```

## Install from local build

To build the SDK from the Iota monorepo, you must use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). With pnpm installed,
run the following command from the `iota` root directory:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
# Run the build for the TypeScript SDK
pnpm sdk build
```

With the SDK built, you can import the library from your `iota` project. To do so, use a path to the
`iota/sdk/typescript` directory that is relative to your project. For example, if you created a
folder `my-iota-project` at the same level as `iota`, use the following to import the locally built
Iota TypeScript package:

```bash
pnpm add ../iota/sdk/typescript
```
