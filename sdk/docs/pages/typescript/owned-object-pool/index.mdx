# Iota Owned Object Pools Quick Start

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type="warning">
	Iota Owned Object Pools (IotaOOP) has been replaced by

    Iota Owned Object Pools (IotaOOP) is no longer maintained.

</Callout>

IotaOOP is a TypeScript library that provides a set of tools for managing multiple concurrent
transactions on the Iota network to help avoid object equivocation and locking.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i iotaoop
```

## Usage

At a high level, this is how you implement the library:

```ts
// Initialize the ExecutorServiceHandler.
const eshandler = await ExecutorServiceHandler.initialize(
adminKeypair,
iotaClient,
);

/// And then for each incoming request...
/// ...get the incoming transaction
const myTransaction;

/// and send it for execution
const promise = eshandler.execute(myTransaction, iotaClient, splitStrategy);
```

See [End-to-End Examples](/typescript/owned-object-pool/examples) for sample code you can run.
