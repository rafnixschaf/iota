IOTA Indexer is an off-fullnode service to serve data from the IOTA protocol, including both data directly generated from chain and derivative data.

## Architecture

![enhanced_FN](../../docs/content/operator/images/indexer-arch.png)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Indexer sync workers require the `NodeConfig::enable_experimental_rest_api` flag set to `true` in the node
> - Fullnodes expose read and transaction execution JSON-RPC APIs. Hence, transactions can be executed through fullnodes.
> - Validators expose only read-only JSON-RPC APIs.
> - Indexer instances expose read, write and extended JSON-RPC APIs.

## Database Schema

For more in depth information check the [Database Schema](./schema.md).

## Steps to run an Indexer locally

### Using docker compose (recommended)

See [pg-services-local](../../docker/pg-services-local/README.md), which automatically sets up the Indexer Sync worker and the Indexer RPC worker along with a postgres database and local network.

### Using manual setup

To run an Indexer, a running postgres instance is required.

#### Database setup

You can either spin up the postgres instance as a single service via [docker-compose](../../docker/pg-services-local/README.md) or manually set up it up.
If you choose for manual setup, follow the steps below:

1. Install a local [Postgres server](https://www.postgresql.org/download) and start it.

2. Install [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/):

`cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres`

3. Make sure you are in the `iota/crates/iota-indexer` directory and run the following command to create the database:

```sh
diesel setup --database-url="postgres://postgres:postgrespw@localhost/iota_indexer"
```

This command will create a database with the name `iota_indexer` to store the indexed data.
Per default, the user is `postgres` and the password is `postgrespw`.

In case the database already exists, you can run the following command to reset the database:

```sh
diesel database reset --database-url="postgres://postgres:postgrespw@localhost/iota_indexer"
```

#### Indexer setup

You can spin up an Indexer as part of [iota-test-validator](../../crates/iota-test-validator/README.md) which creates a simple local network or as a standalone service that connects to an existing fullnode.

To run the indexer as a standalone service with an existing fullnode, follow the steps below.

#### Standalone Indexer setup

- to run the indexer as a writer (Sync worker), which pulls data from a fullnode and writes data to the database

```sh
# Change the RPC_CLIENT_URL to http://0.0.0.0:9000 to run indexer against local validator & fullnode
cargo run --bin iota-indexer -- --db-url "postgres://postgres:postgrespw@localhost/iota_indexer" --rpc-client-url "https://fullnode.devnet.iota.io:443" --fullnode-sync-worker --reset-db
```

- to run indexer as a reader which exposes a JSON RPC service with following [APIs](https://docs.iota.io/iota-api-ref).

```
cargo run --bin iota-indexer -- --db-url "postgres://postgres:postgrespw@localhost/iota_indexer" --rpc-client-url "https://fullnode.devnet.iota.io:443" --rpc-server-worker
```

More available flags can be found in this [file](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/crates/iota-indexer/src/lib.rs).

### DB reset

To wipe the database, make sure you are in the `iota/crates/iota-indexer` directory and run following command. In case of schema changes in `.sql` files, this will also update corresponding `schema.rs` file:

```sh
diesel database reset --database-url="postgres://postgres:postgrespw@localhost/iota_indexer"
```

### Running tests

To run the tests, a running postgres instance is required.

```sh
docker run --name iota-indexer-tests -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgrespw -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=iota_indexer -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

The crate provides following tests currently:

- unit tests for DB models (objects, events) which test the conversion between the database representation and the Rust representation of the objects and events.
- unit tests for the DB query filters, which test the conversion of filters to the correct SQL queries.
- integration tests (see [ingestion_tests](tests/ingestion_tests.rs)) to make sure the indexer correctly indexes transaction data from a full node by comparing the data in the database with the data received from the fullnode.
- rpc tests (see [rpc-tests](tests/rpc-tests/main.rs))

> [!NOTE]
> rpc tests which relies on postgres for every test it applies migrations, we need to run tests sequencially to avoid errors

```sh
# run tests requiring only postgres integration
cargo test --features pg_integration
# run rpc tests with shared runtime
cargo test --features shared_test_runtime
```

For a better testing experience is possible to use [nextest](https://nexte.st/)

> [!NOTE]
> rpc tests which rely on a shared runtime are not supported with `nextest`

```sh
# run tests requiring only postgres integration
cargo nextest run --features pg_integration --test-threads 1
```
