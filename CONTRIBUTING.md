Thanks for considering making a contribution to the IOTA network or its documentation. The IOTA monorepo houses the code that powers and documents the IOTA blockchain. 

## Contribute to IOTA

See [IOTA Environment Setup](https://github.com/iotaledger/kinesis/blob/main/docs/content/guides/developer/getting-started/iota-environment.mdx) for approach to submitting code fixes and enhancements.

If you want to contribute code that creates a feature on IOTA, start with a [IOTA Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/iota-foundation/sips/tree/main) before developing the logic.

Found a bug or security vulnerability? Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/iotaledger/kinesis/issues/new/choose). 

Found a small error or typo in the documentation? Each page on the [iota.docs.io](https://iota.docs.io) site includes an **Edit this page** link at the bottom that you can use to edit the page in GitHub. The content is located in the docs/content directory of the IOTA repo, so you can make a usual PR if you prefer. 

For larger documentation issues, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/iotaledger/kinesis/issues/new/choose) in GitHub. To fix the problem yourself, follow the [documentation contribution](./docs/content/references/contribute/contribution-process.mdx) guidelines.

Want to contribute to the IOTA framework? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/iotaledger/kinesis/blob/main/crates/iota-framework/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information related to `iota-framework` crate contributions.
