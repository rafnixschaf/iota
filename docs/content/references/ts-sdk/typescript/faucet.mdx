# Faucet

Devnet, Testnet, and local networks include faucets that mint IOTA. You can use the IOTA TypeScript
SDK to call a network's faucet and provide IOTA to the address you provide.

To request IOTA from a faucet, import the `requestIotaFromFaucetV0` function from the
`@iota/iota-sdk/faucet` package to your project.

```typescript
import { getFaucetHost, requestIotaFromFaucetV0 } from '@iota/iota-sdk/faucet';
```

Use `requestIotaFromFaucetV0` in your TypeScript code to request IOTA from the network's faucet.

```typescript
await requestIotaFromFaucetV0({
    host: getFaucetHost('testnet'),
    recipient: <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>,
});
```

:::warning Rate Limit
    Faucets on Devnet and Testnet are rate limited. If you run the script too many times, you surpass
    the limit and must wait to successfully run it again.
