title: Move.toml File
description: Get the details for a Move package manifest.
---

Every Move package has a `Move.toml` file as a manifest for the package. The IOTA Move compiler creates the `Move.toml` file for you when you create a new package, but you might need to update the file throughout the lifespan of your package.

The manifest contains information divided into three sections:
* `[package]`: Your package metadata, such as name and version.
* `[dependencies]`: List of packages that your package depends on. Initially, the IOTA Framework is the only dependency, but you add third-party dependencies to this section as needed.
* `[addresses]`: A list of *named addresses*. You can use the names listed as convenient aliases for the given addresses in the source code.

## [package] section

The `[package]` section contains the following information:

* `name`: The name of your package. Created by IOTA Move compiler.
* `version`: The current version of your package. The IOTA Move compiler creates the first value.

## [dependencies] section

The IOTA Move compiler creates the `[dependencies]` section for you with a single entry for the GitHub address of the IOTA network. If you need to use a local version of the network, you can edit the address to point to the local version. For example,

```toml
IOTA = { local = "../crates/iota-framework" }
```

You place each additional dependency your package has on a new line directly below the previous one.

## [addresses] section

The IOTA Move compiler creates the `[addresses]` section for you with an entry for your package and one for the IOTA network.

```toml
[addresses]
your_package_name =  "0x0"
iota =  "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002"
```

The aliases defined in `[addresses]` enable you to reference the shortened name instead of the actual address. For example, when you import from IOTA in a module, you can write:

```move
use iota::transfer
```

Without the alias, you have to write:

```move
// You could also use 0x2
use 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002::transfer
```

Dependency address values can change at different stages of development, also, so using the alias means the change only needs to occur in the manifest.
