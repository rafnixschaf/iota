Move is an open-source language designed for writing secure packages that interact with on-chain objects, commonly known
as smart contracts.
As a platform-agnostic language, Move supports the development of shared libraries, tools, and communities across
blockchains with varying data structures and execution models. It is highly adaptable, allowing it to be customized to
fit the specific requirements of the blockchain it operates on. For
example, [Move on IOTA](../developer/iota-101/move-overview/move-overview.mdx) showcases optimizations made for the IOTA
blockchain.
