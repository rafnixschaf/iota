Before being able to publish your package to Testnet, you need Testnet IOTA tokens. To get some, join the [IOTA Discord](https://discord.gg/IOTA), complete the verification steps, enter the `#testnet-faucet` channel and type `!faucet <WALLET ADDRESS>`. For other ways to get IOTA in your Testnet account, see [Get IOTA Tokens](/developer/getting-started/get-coins).

Now that you have an account with some Testnet IOTA, you can deploy your contracts. To publish your package, use the following command in the same terminal or console:

```
iota client publish
```

For the gas budget, use a standard value such as `20000000`.
