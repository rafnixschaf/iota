title: Trustless Token Swap
hide_table_of_contents: true
---

This guide and example demonstrate an atomic swap on IOTA, which is similar to an escrow but does not require a trusted third party. Instead, this example uses a [shared object](../../../concepts/object-ownership/shared.mdx) to act as the escrow between two IOTA users wanting to trade. Shared objects are a unique concept to IOTA. Any transaction and any signer can modify it, given the changes meet the requirements set forth by the package that defined the type.

:::info

See [Shared versus Owned Objects](../iota-101/shared-owned.mdx) for more information on the differences between object types.

:::

The guide is split into three parts:

1. [Backend](./trustless-token-swap/backend.mdx): The modules that hold the state and perform the swaps.
1. [Indexing and API Service](./trustless-token-swap/indexer-api.mdx): A service that indexes chain state to discover trades, and an API service to read this data.
1. [Frontend](./trustless-token-swap/frontend.mdx): Enables users to list objects for sale and to accept trades.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Installed the latest version of IOTA](../getting-started/iota-install.mdx).
- [Configured a valid network environment](../../../references/cli/client.mdx#set-current-environment), as you will be deploying the module on Testnet.
