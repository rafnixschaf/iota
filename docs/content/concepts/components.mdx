title: Iota Components
---

The name Iota, pronounced swē in English, is derived from a Japanese word for the element of water. You can see this influence in the name of the blockchain, its native token elements (IOTA and NANOS), and the imagery used in its branding. 

When you read about Iota in this documentation, it's referencing all the pieces of the system that comprise the blockchain. This includes the blockchain itself, its various networks (Mainnet, for example), the activity on the blockchain (transaction blocks), the distributed entities that verify this activity (validators), and the Full nodes that execute transaction blocks. The documentation refers to the entirety of these elements as the Iota platform, or simply Iota.

## The Iota blockchain

Iota is defined as a Layer 1 protocol blockchain. In basic terms, this means that Iota performs its own consensus and validation for transaction blocks (activity) on its networks using its own native token (IOTA, in this case). Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) are other examples of Layer 1 blockchains. 

Layer 2 blockchains, by contrast, leverage the infrastructure of Layer 1 networks, relying on the Layer 1 blockchain to finalize transaction blocks. Polygon (MATIC) is an example of a Layer 2 blockchain that extends Ethereum.

## IOTA tokens

The native token for Iota is IOTA. Whenever the documentation mentions IOTA (all uppercase letters), it's referring to this token. Transaction blocks on Iota often deal with small fractions of the value of one IOTA. To make these transaction blocks easier to work with, Iota provides NANOS. It takes one billion NANOS to equal one IOTA. 

There is a cost associated with everything, and blockchain transactions are no exception. It costs money to provide computational power to process transaction blocks and store their results. The term for the cost of processing transaction blocks is "gas". You pay for gas and the cost of storing data with a blockchain's native tokens, in this case, IOTA (or NANOS).

## Delegated proof-of-stake consensus

Iota uses a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism to validate on-chain transaction blocks. This means that validators on the Iota network must have a certain amount of IOTA secured on Iota Mainnet, either with their own funds or in partnership with Iota Foundation, to prove their interest in the security of the blockchain. This approach aligns the interest of all validators with that of Iota users (an efficient, secure blockchain), without the high energy-resource demands of earlier blockchains.

## Iota networks

Iota has several networks available, each serving a different purpose.

- **Mainnet:** The network that processes production transaction blocks. When you trade IOTA or NFTs that are ultimately based on fiat currency, you are doing so on the Mainnet network of Iota.
- **Testnet:** Staging network to provide quality assurance that any planned changes to Iota do not adversely impact performance. Developers can use this network to test their code before placing it in production.
- **Devnet:** A more unstable network that is used to develop new features. Developers can leverage this network to code against the latest planned features of Iota.
- **Localnet:** You can run a Iota network on your local computer. Developing on a local network provides an optimized workflow in an environment you control. 

To learn more about these networks and how to interact with them, see the following guides:

- [Connect to Iota](guides/developer/getting-started/connect.mdx)

## Move

The Move language provides the logic for all activity on Iota, like trading NFTs, playing Iota-integrated games (dApps), and all other transaction-based events. The Iota platform uses a concept novel to earlier blockchains, where blocks on the chain are actually objects that define assets rather than simple key-value stores that define addresses. The increased programmability inherent with objects required a more robust logic engine to maximize the benefits of this new approach to blockchain technology.
