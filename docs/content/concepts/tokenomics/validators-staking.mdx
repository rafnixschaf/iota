title: Validators and Staking Pools
---

Each Iota validator maintains its own staking pool to track the amount of stake and to compound staking rewards. Validator pools operate together with a time series of exchange rates that are computed at each epoch boundary. These exchange rates determine the amount of IOTA tokens that each past IOTA staker can withdraw in the future. Importantly, the exchange rates increase as more rewards are deposited into a staking pool and the longer an amount of IOTA is deposited in a staking pool, the more rewards it will accrue.

When IOTA is deposited to the staking pool in epoch `E`, those IOTA are converted into liquidity tokens at the epoch `E` exchange rate. As the staking pool earns rewards, the exchange rate appreciates. At epoch `E'`, those liquidity tokens are worth more and translate into more IOTA.
The only difference between Iota staking pools and typical liquidity pools is that in Iota the liquidity tokens do not exist. Rather, the global exchange rate table is used to track the accounting. Because all IOTA tokens in the staking pool are treated the same, regardless of whether they were originally deposited as new stake or as stake rewards, all IOTA tokens immediately count as stake and thus compound rewards immediately.

The staking pool is implemented in a system-level smart contract ([staking_pool.move](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-system/sources/staking_pool.move)) and is part of the Iota framework.

## Validator pool exchange rate 

The exchange rate for each validator pool is calculated at each epoch boundary as follows:

Exchange Rate at E+1 = ( 1 + ( Third-Party Staker Rewards at E / Third-Party Stake at E )) ( Exchange Rate at E )

The distinction between third-party owned vs validator-owned rewards and stake is relevant in that validators earn commissions on the staking pool's tokens but third-party stakers do not. This accounting enables Iota to keep track of the rewards accrued by both validators and third-party token holders using a single global exchange rate table.
