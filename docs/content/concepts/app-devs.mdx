The topics in this section explore some of the concepts that are of interest to developers creating smart contracts on IOTA. After becoming familiar with these concepts, be sure to check out the [Guides](../guides.mdx) section for instruction on how to implement these concepts in your own code. 

## GraphQL for IOTA RPC

Basics of the GraphQL service to interact with the IOTA network.

Go to [GraphQL for IOTA RPC](./graphql-rpc.mdx).

## Object Model

The basic unit of storage in IOTA is the object. In contrast to many other blockchains where storage is centered around accounts containing key-value stores, IOTA's storage is centered around objects addressable on-chain by unique IDs. The topics in this section examine the model for objects on IOTA.

Go to [Object Model](./object-model.mdx).

## Move Overview

{@include: ../snippets/move-summary.mdx}

The topics in this section describe some of the key features and coding patterns of Move applied to the IOTA network. 

Go to [Move Overview](./iota-move-concepts.mdx).

## Transactions

Transactions define the history of activity on a blockchain. On IOTA, you can develop complex programmable transaction blocks that perform several transaction commands in a single execution. You can also sponsor transactions for your smart contract users to streamline onboarding. The topics in this section explore transactions on IOTA at a conceptual level.
