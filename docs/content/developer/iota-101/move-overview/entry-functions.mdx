# Public and Entry Functions

The `entry` modifier in Move is a powerful tool that designates a function as an "entrypoint" within a module,
allowing it to be directly invoked from a programmable transaction block.
However, its usage comes with specific constraints designed to ensure security and proper module interaction.

## How `entry` Functions Work

When a function is marked with the `entry` modifier,
it can only be called with parameters that are direct inputs to the transaction block.
These parameters cannot be the results of previous transactions within the same block,
nor can they be altered by preceding transactions.
Additionally, `entry` functions can only return types that possess the `drop` ability.

These restrictions are in place to prevent third-party modules
from exploiting the programmable nature of transaction blocks 
to circumvent the intended limitations on `entry` functions.
Essentially, this ensures that `entry` functions are not called from other modules,
maintaining their integrity and the module's security.

## `public` vs `entry` Functions

The `public` modifier also permits functions to be called from programmable transaction blocks,
but with fewer restrictions:

- **Inter-Module Accessibility:** Functions marked as `public` can be called from other modules, whereas `entry` functions cannot.
- **Parameter Flexibility:** `public` functions do not have the same limitations on parameter origins, allowing more flexibility in how they are used within transaction blocks.
- **Return Types:** Unlike `entry` functions, `public` functions are not restricted to returning types with the `drop` ability.

In many cases, using the `public` modifier is the right choice for exposing your function to the outside world. However, there are specific scenarios where `entry` functions are preferable:

## Preventing Unintended Interactions

If you need to ensure that your function does not interact with other third-party module functions within a transaction block,
the `entry` modifier is ideal.
For example, in a swap protocol, using `entry` functions can prevent the protocol from interacting with a flash loan provider. Since a flash loaned `Coin` would be the output of a previous transaction, it cannot be passed into an `entry` function, maintaining the integrity of the swap protocol.

## Avoiding ABI Exposure

Functions marked as `public` have their signatures included in the module's ABI and must be maintained across upgrades.
In contrast, `entry` functions do not have this requirement,
making them useful for functions that you want to keep out of the ABI.

### `public entry` Functions

You can also create a `public entry` function,
which combines the characteristics of both `public` and `entry` modifiers.
Such functions can be called by other modules and programmable transaction blocks
but are restricted like an `entry` function when invoked within transaction blocks.
This combination is rarely necessary,
as in most cases, you will want to choose either `public` or `entry` based on the specific needs of your module.
