# Understanding One-Time Witness in Move

A One-Time Witness (OTW) is a unique type in Move, specifically designed to ensure that certain actions within a module can only occur once. This type is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to limit an operation, such as the creation of a coin, to a single instance. A type qualifies as a OTW in Move if it meets the following criteria:

- **Naming Convention:** The type's name matches its module's name, fully uppercased.
- **Abilities:** The type has the `drop` ability and no other abilities.
- **Structure:** The type contains either no fields or a single `bool` field.

The only instance of this type is automatically passed to the module’s `init` function during the package’s publication, ensuring it cannot be created or instantiated elsewhere.

To verify if a type can be used as a OTW,
you can pass an instance of it to [`iota::types::is_one_time_witness`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/types.mdx#function-is_one_time_witness).



## Example

The following example demonstrates how to implement and utilize a OTW in a Move module:
