# Abilities: Introduction

Move has a unique type system which allows customizing _type abilities_.
In the [struct section](./struct.mdx), we introduced the `struct` definition and how to use it.
However, the instances of the `Artist` and `Record` structs had to be unpacked for the code to
compile. This is default behavior of a struct without _abilities_.

::: info
Throughout the documentation, you will see struct definitions with abilities. This section will cover abilities in detail, how they work, and how to use them
in Move.
:::

## What are Abilities?

Abilities are a way to allow certain behaviors for a type. They are a part of the struct declaration
and define which behaviours are allowed for the instances of the struct.

## Abilities syntax

Abilities are set in the struct definition using the `has` keyword followed by a list of abilities.
The abilities are separated by commas. Move supports 4 abilities: `copy`, `drop`, `key`, and
`store`, each of them is used to define a specific behaviour for the struct instances.

```move
/// This struct has the `copy` and `drop` abilities.
struct VeryAble has copy, drop {
    // field: Type1,
    // field2: Type2,
    // ...
}
```

## Overview

A quick overview of the abilities:

:::info
All of the built-in types, except references, have `copy`, `drop` and `store` abilities.
References have `copy` and `drop`.
:::

- `copy` - allows the struct to be _copied_. Explained in the [Ability: Copy](./copy.mdx)
  section.
- `drop` - allows the struct to be _dropped_ or _discarded_. Explained in the
  [Ability: Drop](./drop.mdx) section.
- `key` - allows the struct to be used as a _key_ in a storage. Explained in the
  [Ability: Key](./key.mdx) section.
- `store` - allows the struct to be _stored_ in structs with the _key_ ability. Explained in the
  [Ability: Store](./store.mdx) section.

While it is important to mention them here, we will go in detail about each ability in the following
sections and give a proper context on how to use them.

## No Abilities

A struct without abilities cannot be discarded, or copied, or stored. We call such a
struct a _Hot Potato_. It is a joke, but it is also a good way to remember that a struct without
abilities is like a hot potato - it can only be passed around and requires special handling. Hot
Potato is one of the most powerful patterns in Move, we go in detail about it in the
[Hot Potato](../patterns/hot-potato.mdx) chapter.
