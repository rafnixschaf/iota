# ID Pointer

The ID pointer is a technique used in Move to separate the main data (an object) 
from its accessors or capabilities by linking these accessors back to the original object.
This pattern can be applied in several ways:

- Implementing transferable capabilities for shared objects, such as a `TransferCap` that updates the 'owner' field of a shared object.
- Separating dynamic data from static data, for instance, distinguishing between an NFT and its collection information.
- Avoiding unnecessary type linking (and witness requirements) in generic applications, like a Liquidity Pool (LP) token for a `LiquidityPool`.

The following example demonstrates basic `Lock` and `Key` mechanics on IOTA,
where a `Lock<T>` is a shared object that can hold any content, 
and a `Key` is an owned object that is necessary to access the contents of the lock.

The `Key` is connected to its `Lock` through an `ID` field. 
This setup enables off-chain discovery of the target, 
while also separating the dynamic transferable capability from the 'static' contents. 
An additional benefit is that the target asset remains discoverable even when its `Key` is wrapped within another object,
such as a marketplace listing.

This pattern is demonstrated in the [Hero](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/main/examples/move/hero/sources/example.move) example.
