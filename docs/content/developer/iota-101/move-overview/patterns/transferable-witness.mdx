# Transferable Witness

The transferable witness pattern combines elements of both [capability](capabilities.mdx)
and [witness](witness.mdx) patterns to provide flexible and controlled authorization mechanisms.
While the traditional witness pattern restricts spawning to authorized users,
there are cases where authorization needs to be delegated across different modules or delayed over time.
In such scenarios, a storable and transferable witness offers an effective solution.

## When to Use Transferable Witness

This pattern is particularly useful in situations such as:

### Cross-Module Authorization

Allowing a type authorized by one module to be utilized securely in another module.

### Deferred Authorization:

Enabling authorization to occur after a certain condition is met or a specific time has passed.

### Single-Use Access Control

Providing a mechanism that ensures a witness can be used only once, enhancing security and preventing misuse.

## Implementing Transferable Witness in Move

The example below demonstrates how to implement a transferable witness using Move.
It defines a `WITNESS` struct that can be stored and transferred within a `WitnessCarrier`.
This carrier can be sent to authorized users, who can then extract the witness when needed.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/patterns/transferable-witness.move
```

- **`WITNESS` Struct:** Defined with `store` and `drop` abilities, allowing it to be stored persistently and cleaned up after use.

- **`WitnessCarrier` Struct:** Acts as a container for the `WITNESS`, with a unique identifier (`id`). This carrier can be transferred between parties, providing controlled access to the witness.

- **`init` Function:** Upon module initialization, a new `WitnessCarrier` is created and transferred to the module publisher. This setup ensures that only authorized entities receive the carrier.

- **`get_witness` Function:** Allows extraction of the `WITNESS` from the carrier. This function consumes the `WitnessCarrier`, ensuring that the witness can only be retrieved once, thus maintaining single-use access control.

## Advantages of Transferable Witness

- **Flexibility:** Enables complex authorization flows across different modules and over time.
- **Security:** Ensures that witnesses are used appropriately through single-use consumption and controlled transfer mechanisms.
- **Modularity:** Supports clean separation of concerns by allowing authorization logic to be encapsulated and reused across various parts of the system.
