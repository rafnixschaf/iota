# Conventions

The following recommendations are based on 2024 Move.

## Add Section Titles

Use section titles in code comments to organize your Move code files. Structure your titles using `===` on either side of the title.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/comments.move
```

## CRUD Function Names

The following are recommended names for CRUD functions:

- `add`: Adds a value.
- `new`: Creates an object.
- `drop`: Drops a struct.
- `empty`: Creates a struct.
- `remove`: Removes a value.
- `exists_`: Checks if a key exists.
- `contains`: Checks if a collection contains a value.
- `destroy_empty`: Destroys an object or data structure that contains values with the **drop** ability.
- `to_object_name`: Transforms Object X to Object Y.
- `from_object_name`: Transforms Object Y to Object X.
- `property_name`: Returns an immutable reference or a copy.
- `property_name_mut`: Returns a mutable reference.

## Potato Structs

Avoid using 'potato' in the names of structs. The absence of abilities defines a potato pattern.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/potato.move
```

## Read Functions

When naming functions, be mindful of the dot syntax. Avoid using the object name in function names.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/read.move
```

## Empty Function

Name functions that create data structures as `empty`.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/empty.move
```

## New Function

Name functions that create objects as `new`.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/new.move
```

## Shared Objects

Library modules that share objects should provide two functions:
one to create the object and another to share it.
This allows the caller to access its UID and execute custom functionality before sharing it.

`
```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/shared.move
```

## Reference Functions

Name functions that return a reference as `<PROPERTY-NAME>_mut` or `<PROPERTY-NAME>`,
replacing `<PROPERTY-NAME>` with the actual name of the property.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/reference.move
```

## Separation of Concerns

Design your modules around a single object or data structure.
A variant structure should have its own module to minimize complexity and reduce the likelihood of bugs.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/separation.move
```

## Errors

Use PascalCase for errors, starting with an `E` and ensuring they are descriptive.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/errors.move
```

## Struct Property Comments

Document the properties of your structs with comments.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/struct-comments.move
```

## Destroy Functions

Provide functions to delete objects. Use the `destroy_empty` function to destroy empty objects, and the `drop` function for objects containing types that can be dropped.

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/destroy.move
```

## Pure Functions

Keep your functions pure to maintain composability.
Avoid using `transfer::transfer` or `transfer::public_transfer` within core functions.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/pure.move
```

## Coin Argument

Pass the `Coin` object by value with the correct amount directly,
as this improves transaction readability from the frontend.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/coin-arg.move
```

## Access Control

To maintain composability, use capabilities instead of addresses for access control.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/access-control.move
```

## Data Storage in Owned vs. Shared Objects

For data with a one-to-one relationship, it's best to use owned objects.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/data-storage.move
```
## Admin Capability

In admin-gated functions, the first parameter should be the capability.
This helps with autocomplete for user types.



```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/conventions/admin-cap.move
```
