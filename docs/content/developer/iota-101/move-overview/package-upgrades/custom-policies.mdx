# Custom Policies

Relying on a single key to manage on-chain package upgrades can introduce significant security vulnerabilities:

<UpgradeSingleKeyRisk />

To mitigate these risks while still enabling [live package upgrades](./upgrade.mdx),
IOTA offers _custom upgrade policies_.
These policies secure access to the [`UpgradeCap`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx#resource-upgradecap) and issue [`UpgradeTicket`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx#struct-upgradeticket) objects,
authorizing upgrades on a per-case basis.

## Compatibility

IOTA provides several built-in package compatibility policies, ordered from most to least strict:

| Policy              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Immutable**       | Prevents any upgrades to the package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Dependency-only** | Limits modifications to the package’s dependencies only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Additive**        | Allows adding new functionalities (e.g., new public functions or structs) but restricts changes to existing functionalities.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Compatible**      | The least restrictive policy. Permits changes to all function implementations, the removal of ability constraints on generic type parameters in function signatures, and modifications to `private`, `public(friend)`, and `entry` function signatures. However, `public` function signatures and existing types cannot be changed. |

Each policy is a superset of the previous one, allowing progressively more flexibility in package upgrades.

When you publish a package, it defaults to the most relaxed, compatible policy.
However, you can adjust the policy during the transaction that publishes the package,
setting the desired policy level before the package goes live on-chain.

You can restrict the current policy by invoking functions from the `iota::package` module
(`only_additive_upgrades`, `only_dep_upgrades`, `make_immutable`) on the package's `UpgradeCap`.
Note that a policy can only become more restrictive over time.
For example, after applying the `only_dep_upgrades` policy,
attempting to set a less restrictive policy like `only_additive_upgrades` will result in an error.

## Upgrade Process Overview

Package upgrades must be executed in a single transaction, involving three key steps:

1. **Authorization:** Obtain permission via the `UpgradeCap`, creating an `UpgradeTicket`.
2. **Execution:** Use the `UpgradeTicket` to verify package bytecode and compatibility, and create the upgraded package on-chain. A successful upgrade returns an `UpgradeReceipt`.
3. **Commit:** Update the `UpgradeCap` with the new package information.

While step 2 is handled internally, steps 1 and 3 are implemented as Move functions.
The IOTA framework provides basic implementations:

```move
module iota::package {
    public fun authorize_upgrade(
        cap: &mut UpgradeCap,
        policy: u8,
        digest: vector<u8>
    ): UpgradeTicket;

    public fun commit_upgrade(
        cap: &mut UpgradeCap,
        receipt: UpgradeReceipt,
    );
}
```

These functions are invoked by the `iota client upgrade` command for authorization and commit.
Custom upgrade policies can be created by adding additional conditions to these functions,
such as voting mechanisms, governance models, permission lists, or timelocks.

Any function pair that produces an `UpgradeTicket` from an `UpgradeCap` and consumes an `UpgradeReceipt` to update the `UpgradeCap` constitutes a custom upgrade policy.

## UpgradeCap

The [`UpgradeCap`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx#resource-upgradecap) type is crucial for managing package upgrades:

```move
module iota::package {
public struct UpgradeCap has key, store {
id: UID,
package: ID,
version: u64,
policy: u8,
}
}
```

Creating a package automatically generates the `UpgradeCap` object, and any upgrades modify this object. The owner of the `UpgradeCap` has the authority to:

- Modify compatibility requirements for future upgrades.
- Approve future upgrades.
- Make the package immutable.

The `UpgradeCap` ensures the following:

- Only the latest package version can be upgraded, maintaining a linear upgrade history.
- Only one upgrade can be in progress at any given time.
- Upgrades must be authorized and completed within a single transaction.

## UpgradeTicket

```move
module iota::package {
    public struct UpgradeTicket {
        cap: ID,
        package: ID,
        policy: u8,
        digest: vector<u8>,
    }
}
```

An [`UpgradeTicket`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx#struct-upgradeticket) is a proof of authorization for an upgrade,
specific to:

- The latest package version identified by `package: ID`.
- The compatibility policy defined by `policy: u8`.
- The package contents specified by `digest: vector<u8>`.

The upgrade process checks that these conditions match before proceeding.
The `UpgradeTicket` must be used within the same transaction it was created; otherwise, the transaction fails.

### Package Digest

The `digest` in the `UpgradeTicket` comes from the `digest` parameter passed to `authorize_upgrade`.
While the function itself does not process the digest,
custom policies can use it to verify upgrades against pre-approved bytecode or source code. 
The digest is calculated by:

- Taking the bytecode of each module as an array of bytes.
- Appending the list of the package's transitive dependencies, each represented as an array of bytes.
- Sorting this list lexicographically.
- Hashing each element in the sorted list using the `Blake2B` algorithm.
- Computing the final digest from the hash state.

- Typically, the Move toolchain outputs the digest during the build process when using the `--dump-bytecode-as-base64` flag:

```bash
iota move build --dump-bytecode-as-base64
FETCHING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Iota
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING test
{"modules":[<MODULE-BYTES-BASE64>],"dependencies":[<DEPENDENCY-IDS>],"digest":[59,43,173,195,216,88,176,182,18,8,24,200,200,192,196,197,248,35,118,184,207,205,33,59,228,109,184,230,50,31,235,201]}
```

## UpgradeReceipt

```move
module iota::package {
public struct UpgradeReceipt {
cap: ID,
package: ID,
}
    public struct UpgradeReceipt {
        cap: ID,
        package: ID,
    }
}
```

An [`UpgradeReceipt`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx#struct-upgradereceipt) confirms
that the upgrade was successfully executed, and the new package was added to the transaction's created objects.

The `UpgradeReceipt` must be used within the same transaction to update the `UpgradeCap`
, or the transaction will fail.

## Best Practices for Custom Upgrade Policies

When creating custom upgrade policies, it's advisable to:

- Implement them in a separate package from the code they govern.
- Make the policy package immutable to prevent future changes.
- Lock the `UpgradeCap` policy to prevent less restrictive changes later on.

These practices help ensure **informed user consent** and **bounded risk**,
making it clear what the upgrade policy is when a user interacts with the package,
and ensuring that the policy does not become more permissive over time without user knowledge and consent.

## Example: "Day of the Week" Upgrade Policy

In this example, you'll create a simple upgrade policy that allows package upgrades only on a specific day of the week,
as chosen by the package creator.

### Creating the Upgrade Policy

Start by creating a new Move package to contain your upgrade policy:

```bash
iota move new policy
```

This command creates a `policy` directory with a `sources` folder and a `Move.toml` manifest file.

Next, navigate to the `sources` folder and create a new file named `day_of_week.move`.
Insert the following code into this file:

```move
module policy::day_of_week {
use iota::package;

    public struct UpgradeCap has key, store {
        id: UID,
        cap: package::UpgradeCap,
        day: u8,
    }

    /// Error code indicating that the provided day is not a valid weekday (must be between 0 and 6).
    const ENotWeekDay: u64 = 1;

    public fun new_policy(
        cap: package::UpgradeCap,
        day: u8,
        ctx: &mut TxContext,
    ): UpgradeCap {
        assert!(day < 7, ENotWeekDay);
        UpgradeCap { id: object::new(ctx), cap, day }
    }
}
```

This code defines a new struct, `UpgradeCap`,
and a constructor function `new_policy`
that initializes the custom upgrade policy based on the specified day of the week.

Next, add a function to authorize upgrades only on the correct day of the week.
Start by defining two constants: one for the error code indicating an upgrade attempt on a disallowed day,
and another for the number of milliseconds in a day:

```move
/// Error code for an attempted upgrade on the wrong day.
const ENotAllowedDay: u64 = 2;

/// Number of milliseconds in a day.
const MS_IN_DAY: u64 = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
```

After the `new_policy` function, add the `week_day` function, which calculates the current day of the week:

```move
fun week_day(ctx: &TxContext): u8 {
    let days_since_unix_epoch =
        tx_context::epoch_timestamp_ms(ctx) / MS_IN_DAY;
    // The unix epoch (1st Jan 1970) was a Thursday so shift days
    // since the epoch by 3 so that 0 = Monday.
    ((days_since_unix_epoch + 3) % 7 as u8)
}
```

This function uses the transaction context's epoch timestamp to determine the current weekday.

Next, add an `authorize_upgrade` function that checks whether today matches the allowed upgrade day and authorizes the upgrade if it does:

```move
public fun authorize_upgrade(
    cap: &mut UpgradeCap,
    policy: u8,
    digest: vector<u8>,
    ctx: &TxContext,
): package::UpgradeTicket {
    assert!(week_day(ctx) == cap.day, ENotAllowedDay);
    package::authorize_upgrade(&mut cap.cap, policy, digest)
}
```

The signature of a custom `authorize_upgrade` can be different from the signature of `iota::package::authorize_upgrade` as long as it returns an `UpgradeTicket`.

Finally, add implementations for the `commit_upgrade` and `make_immutable` functions,
which delegate to the corresponding functions in the `iota::package` module:

```move
public fun commit_upgrade(
    cap: &mut UpgradeCap,
    receipt: package::UpgradeReceipt,
) {
    package::commit_upgrade(&mut cap.cap, receipt)
}

public fun make_immutable(cap: UpgradeCap) {
    let UpgradeCap { id, cap, day: _ } = cap;
    object::delete(id);
    package::make_immutable(cap);
}
```

The final version of your `day_of_week.move` file should look like this:

```move
module policy::day_of_week {
    use iota::package;

    public struct UpgradeCap has key, store {
        id: UID,
        cap: package::UpgradeCap,
        day: u8,
    }

    // Day is not a week day (number in range 0 <= day < 7).
    const ENotWeekDay: u64 = 1;
    const ENotAllowedDay: u64 = 2;
    const MS_IN_DAY: u64 = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

    public fun new_policy(
        cap: package::UpgradeCap,
        day: u8,
        ctx: &mut TxContext,
    ): UpgradeCap {
        assert!(day < 7, ENotWeekDay);
        UpgradeCap { id: object::new(ctx), cap, day }
    }

    fun week_day(ctx: &TxContext): u8 {
        let days_since_unix_epoch =
            iota::tx_context::epoch_timestamp_ms(ctx) / MS_IN_DAY;
        // The unix epoch (1st Jan 1970) was a Thursday so shift days
        // since the epoch by 3 so that 0 = Monday.
        ((days_since_unix_epoch + 3) % 7 as u8)
    }

    public fun authorize_upgrade(
        cap: &mut UpgradeCap,
        policy: u8,
        digest: vector<u8>,
        ctx: &TxContext,
    ): package::UpgradeTicket {
        assert!(week_day(ctx) == cap.day, ENotAllowedDay);
        package::authorize_upgrade(&mut cap.cap, policy, digest)
    }

    public fun commit_upgrade(
        cap: &mut UpgradeCap,
        receipt: package::UpgradeReceipt,
    ) {
        package::commit_upgrade(&mut cap.cap, receipt)
    }

    public fun make_immutable(cap: UpgradeCap) {
        let UpgradeCap { id, cap, day: _ } = cap;
        object::delete(id);
        package::make_immutable(cap);
    }
}
```

### Publishing an Upgrade Policy

You can use the `iota client publish` command to publish the policy.

```bash
iota client publish
```

```bash
iota client call \

    --function 'make_immutable' \
    --args '<POLICY-UPGRADE-CAP>'

With your custom upgrade policy deployed on-chain, you’ll need a package to upgrade.
This section will guide you through creating a basic package that you can reference in the following scenarios.
If you already have a package, feel free to use it instead of creating a new one.

If you don’t have a package available, use the following command to create a new Move package template named `example`:

```bash
iota move new example
```

In the `example/sources` directory, create a new file named `example.move` with the following code:

```move
module example::example {
public struct Event has copy, drop { x: u64 }

    entry fun nudge() {
        iota::event::emit(Event { x: 41 })
    }
}
```

This basic package contains an `Event` struct and a function `nudge` that emits the event with a value of `41`.
In the instructions that follow,
you'll publish this package and then upgrade it to change the value emitted in the `Event`.

### Using the TypeScript SDK

To publish and upgrade the package using your custom policy,
you'll need to use the [IOTA TypeScript SDK](../../../../ts-sdk/typescript/index.mdx).

#### 1. Set Up a Node.js Project

Create a new directory for your Node.js project. Inside this directory, initialize the project with `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.
Alternatively, you can create the file manually.
Ensure the `package.json` includes the following JSON:

```JSON
{ "type": "module" }
```

#### 2. Install the IOTA TypeScript SDK

Open a terminal in your project directory and run the following command
to install the IOTA TypeScript SDK as a dependency:

```bash
npm install @iota/iota-sdk
```

### Publishing a Package with a Custom Policy

Next, you’ll publish your package, wrapping its `UpgradeCap` with the "Day of the Week" policy you created earlier.
Follow these steps:

#### 1. Create a Script to Publish the Package

In the root of your Node.js project, create a script file named `publish.js`.
Open the file and start by defining constants for the IOTA CLI binary location and the `POLICY_PACKAGE_ID` of your published `day_of_week` package:

```js
const IOTA = 'iota';
const POLICY_PACKAGE_ID = '<POLICY-PACKAGE>';
```

#### 2. Get the Signer Key Pair

Add boilerplate code to retrieve the signer key pair for the currently active address in the IOTA Client CLI:


```js
import { execSync } from 'child_process';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { homedir } from 'os';
import path from 'path';

import { Ed25519Keypair } from '@iota/iota-sdk/keypairs/ed25519';
import { fromBase64 } from '@iota/iota-sdk/utils';

const sender = execSync(`${IOTA} client active-address`, { encoding: 'utf8' }).trim();
const signer = (() => {
    const keystore = JSON.parse(
        readFileSync(
            path.join(homedir(), '.iota', 'iota_config', 'iota.keystore'),
            'utf8',
        )
    );

    for (const priv of keystore) {
        const raw = fromBase64(priv);
        if (raw[0] !== 0) {
            continue;
        }

        const pair = Ed25519Keypair.fromSecretKey(raw.slice(1));
        if (pair.getPublicKey().toIotaAddress() === sender) {
            return pair;
        }
    }

    throw new Error(`keypair not found for sender: ${sender}`);
})();
```

#### 3. Define the Package Path

Define the path to the package you want to publish. 
The following snippet assumes that the package is in a sibling directory to `publish.js`, named `example`:

```js
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

const __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
// Location of package relative to current directory
const packagePath = path.join(__dirname, 'example');
```

#### 4. Build the Package

Build the package using the following code:

```js
const { modules, dependencies } = JSON.parse(
    execSync(
        `${IOTA} move build --dump-bytecode-as-base64 --path ${packagePath}`,
        { encoding: 'utf-8'},
    ),
);
```

#### 5. Construct and Execute the Transaction

Construct the transaction to publish the package,
wrap its `UpgradeCap` in the "Day of the Week" policy (allowing upgrades only on Tuesdays),
and send the new policy back:

```js
import { Transaction } from '@iota/iota-sdk/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();
const packageUpgradeCap = tx.publish({ modules, dependencies });
const tuesdayUpgradeCap = tx.moveCall({
    target: `${POLICY_PACKAGE_ID}::day_of_week::new_policy`,
    arguments: [
        packageUpgradeCap,
        tx.pure(1), // Tuesday
    ],
});

tx.transferObjects([tuesdayUpgradeCap], tx.pure(sender));
```

Finally, execute the transaction and display its effects in the console.
The following snippet assumes you’re running your examples against a local network.
Pass `devnet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet` to the `getFullnodeUrl()` function to run on Devnet,
Testnet, or Mainnet, respectively:

```js
import { getFullnodeUrl, IotaClient } from '@iota/iota-sdk/client';

const client = new IotaClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('localnet')})
const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
    signer,
    transaction: tx,
    options: {
        showEffects: true,
        showObjectChanges: true,
    }
});

console.log(result)
```

            'utf8',
        )
    );

    for (const priv of keystore) {
        const raw = fromBase64(priv);
        if (raw[0] !== 0) {
            continue;
        }

        const pair = Ed25519Keypair.fromSecretKey(raw.slice(1));
        if (pair.getPublicKey().toIotaAddress() === sender) {
            return pair;
        }

### Upgrading a Package with Custom Policy

With your package published,
you can prepare an `upgrade.js` script to perform an upgrade using the custom "Day of the Week" policy.
The script behaves similarly to `publish.js`,
but also captures the package's `digest` during the build process.
The transaction then performs the three upgrade commands:
authorize, execute, and commit.
Below is the full script for `upgrade.js`:

```js
import { execSync } from 'child_process';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { homedir } from 'os';
import path from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

import { getFullnodeUrl, IotaClient } from '@iota/iota-sdk/client';
import { Ed25519Keypair } from '@iota/iota-sdk/keypairs/ed25519';
import { Transaction, UpgradePolicy } from '@iota/iota-sdk/transactions';
import { fromBase64 } from '@iota/iota-sdk/utils';

const IOTA = 'iota';
const POLICY_PACKAGE_ID = '<POLICY-PACKAGE>';
const EXAMPLE_PACKAGE_ID = '<EXAMPLE-PACKAGE>';
const CAP_ID = '<EXAMPLE-UPGRADE-CAP>';
const sender = execSync(`${IOTA} client active-address`, { encoding: 'utf8' }).trim();
const signer = (() => {
    const keystore = JSON.parse(
        readFileSync(
            path.join(homedir(), '.iota', 'iota_config', 'iota.keystore'),
            'utf8',
        )
    );

    for (const priv of keystore) {
        const raw = fromBase64(priv);
        if (raw[0] !== 0) {
            continue;
        }

        const pair = Ed25519Keypair.fromSecretKey(raw.slice(1));
        if (pair.getPublicKey().toIotaAddress() === sender) {
            return pair;
        }
    }

    throw new Error(`keypair not found for sender: ${sender}`);
})();

const __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
const packagePath = path.join(__dirname, 'example');

const { modules, dependencies, digest } = JSON.parse(
    execSync(
        `${IOTA} move build --dump-bytecode-as-base64 --path ${packagePath}`,
        { encoding: 'utf-8'},
    ),
);

const tx = new Transaction();
const cap = tx.object(CAP_ID);
const ticket = tx.moveCall({
    target: `${POLICY_PACKAGE_ID}::day_of_week::authorize_upgrade`,
    arguments: [
        cap,
        tx.pure(UpgradePolicy.COMPATIBLE),
        tx.pure(digest),
    ],
});

const receipt = tx.upgrade({
    modules,
    dependencies,
    packageId: EXAMPLE_PACKAGE_ID,
    ticket,
});

tx.moveCall({
    target: `${POLICY_PACKAGE_ID}::day_of_week::commit_upgrade`,
    arguments: [cap, receipt],
});

const client = new IotaClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('localnet') });
const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
    signer,
    transaction: tx,
    options: {
        showEffects: true,
        showObjectChanges: true,
    }
});

console.log(result);
```

If today isn't Tuesday, you'll need to wait until the next Tuesday to run the script,
as your policy only allows upgrades on that day.
Once it's Tuesday, update your `example.move` file so that the event emits a different constant,
then use Node.js to run the upgrade script:

```bash
node upgrade.js
```

If the script is successful (and today is Tuesday), your console displays the following response:

Now, the `Events` section shows that the `x` field has a value of `42`, updated from the original `41`.

If you try to perform the first upgrade before Tuesday or modify the constant and attempt the upgrade on a different day,
the script will return an error message indicating that the upgrade failed with code `2` (`ENotAllowedDay`):

```bash
...
status: {
        status: 'failure',
        error: 'MoveAbort(MoveLocation { module: ModuleId { address: <POLICY-PACKAGE>, name: Identifier("day_of_week") }, function: 1, instruction: 11, function_name: Some("authorize_upgrade") }, 2) in command 0'
      },
...
```
