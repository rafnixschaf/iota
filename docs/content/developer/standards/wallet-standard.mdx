title: Wallet Standard
description: The Wallet Standard defines how wallets can automatically be discovered and interacted with from dApps.
---

Browser extension wallets built for IOTA are defined using the [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/). This is a cross-chain standard that defines how wallets can automatically be discovered and interacted with from dApps.

If you are building a wallet, we publish a helper library `@iota/wallet-standard` which provides types and utilities that make it simple to get started.

### Creating a wallet interface

You need to create a class that represents your wallet. You can use the `Wallet` interface from
`@iota/wallet-standard` to help ensure your class adheres to the standard.

```tsx
import { IOTA_TESTNET_CHAIN, Wallet } from '@iota/wallet-standard';

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
  get version() {
    // Return the version of the Wallet Standard this implements (in this case, 1.0.0).
    return '1.0.0';
  }
  get name() {
    return 'Wallet Name';
  }
  get icon() {
    return 'some-icon-data-url';
  }
  // Return the IOTA chains that your wallet supports.
  get chains() {
    return [IOTA_TESTNET_CHAIN];
  }
}
```

### Implementing features

Features are standard methods consumers can use to interact with a wallet. To be listed in the IOTA
wallet adapter, you must implement the following features in your wallet:

- `standard:connect` - Used to initiate a connection to the wallet.
- `standard:events` - Used to listen for changes that happen within the wallet, such as accounts
  being added or removed.
- `iota:signPersonalMessage` - Used to prompt the user to sign a personal message, and return the
  message signature back to the dApp. This can be used to verify the user’s public key.
- `iota:signTransactionBlock` - Used to prompt the user to sign a transaction block, and return the
  serialized transaction block and signature back to the dApp. This method does not submit the
  transaction block for execution.
- `iota:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` - Used to prompt the user to sign a transaction, then submit
  it for execution to the blockchain.

You can implement these features in your wallet class under the `features` property:

```tsx
import {
  ConnectFeature,
  ConnectMethod,
  EventsFeature,
  EventsOnMethod,
  IOTAFeatures,
  IOTASignPersonalMessageMethod,
  IOTASignTransactionBlockMethod,
  IOTASignAndExecuteTransactionBlockMethod
} from "@iota/wallet-standard";

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
  /* ... existing code from above ... */

  get features(): ConnectFeature & EventsFeature & IOTAFeatures {
    return {
      "standard:connect": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        connect: this.#connect,
      },
      "standard:events": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        on: this.#on,
      },
      "iota:signPersonalMessage": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        signPersonalMessage: this.#signPersonalMessage,
      },
      "iota:signTransactionBlock": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        signTransactionBlock: this.#signTransactionBlock,
      },
      "iota:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        signAndExecuteTransactionBlock: this.#signAndExecuteTransactionBlock,
      },
    };
  },

  #on: EventsOnMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's events on implementation.
  };

  #connect: ConnectMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's connect implementation
  };

  #signPersonalMessage: IOTASignPersonalMessageMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signTransaction implementation
  };

  #signTransactionBlock: IOTASignTransactionBlockMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signTransaction implementation
  };

  #signAndExecuteTransactionBlock: IOTASignAndExecuteTransactionBlockMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signAndExecuteTransaction implementation
  };
}
```

### Exposing accounts

The last requirement of the wallet interface is to expose an `accounts` interface. This should
expose all of the accounts that a connected dApp has access to. It can be empty prior to initiating
a connection through the `standard:connect` feature.

The accounts can use the `ReadonlyWalletAccount` class to easily construct an account matching the
required interface.

```tsx
import { ReadonlyWalletAccount } from '@iota/wallet-standard';

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
  get accounts() {
    // Assuming we already have some internal representation of accounts:
    return someWalletAccounts.map(
      (walletAccount) =>
        // Return
        new ReadonlyWalletAccount({
          address: walletAccount.iotaAddress,
          publicKey: walletAccount.pubkey,
          // The IOTA chains that your wallet supports.
          chains: [IOTA_TESTNET_CHAIN],
          // The features that this account supports. This can be a subset of the wallet's supported features.
          // These features must exist on the wallet as well.
          features: [
            'iota:signPersonalMessage',
            'iota:signTransactionBlock',
            'iota:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock',
          ],
        }),
    );
  }
}
```

### Registering in the window

Once you have a compatible interface for your wallet, you register it using the `registerWallet`
function.

```tsx
import { registerWallet } from '@iota/wallet-standard';

registerWallet(new YourWallet());
```
