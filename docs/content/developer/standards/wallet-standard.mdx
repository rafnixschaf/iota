title: Wallet Standard
description: The Wallet standard defines how wallets can automatically be discovered and interacted with from dApps.
---

Browser extension wallets built for IOTA use the [Wallet standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/). This is a cross-chain standard that defines how dApps can automatically discover and interact with wallets.

If you are building a wallet, the helper library `@iota/wallet-standard` provides types and utilities to help get started.

## Working With Wallets

The Wallet standard includes features to help build wallets.

### Creating a Wallet Interface

Create a class that represents your wallet. Use the `Wallet` interface from
`@iota/wallet-standard` to help ensure your class adheres to the standard.

```tsx
import { IOTA_DEVNET_CHAIN, Wallet } from '@iota/wallet-standard';

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
	get version() {
		// Return the version of the Wallet Standard this implements (in this case, 1.0.0).
		return '1.0.0';
	}
	get name() {
		return 'Wallet Name';
	}
	get icon() {
		return 'some-icon-data-url';
	}
	// Return the IOTA chains that your wallet supports.
	get chains() {
		return [IOTA_DEVNET_CHAIN];
	}
}
```

### Implementing Features

Features are standard methods consumers can use to interact with a wallet. To be listed in the IOTA
wallet adapter, you must implement the following features in your wallet:

- `standard:connect` - Use to initiate a connection to the wallet.
- `standard:events` - Use to listen for changes that happen within the wallet, such as accounts
  being added or removed.
- `iota:signPersonalMessage` - Use to prompt the user to sign a personal message and return the
  message signature back to the dApp. Use this to verify the user’s public key.
- `iota:signTransaction` - Use to prompt the user to sign a transaction and return the serialized
  transaction and signature back to the dApp. This method does not submit the transaction for
  execution.
- `iota:signAndExecuteTransaction` - Use to prompt the user to sign a transaction, then submit it
  for execution to the blockchain.
- `iota:reportTransactionEffects` - Use to report the effects of a transaction executed in the dApp
  to the wallet. This allows the wallet to update its internal state to reflect the changes the transaction makes.
- `iota:signTransactionBlock` - The previous version of `iota:signTransaction`. Still
  implemented for compatibility with dApps that have not updated to the new feature.
- `iota:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` - The previous version of `iota:signAndExecuteTransaction`. Still implemented for compatibility with dApps that have not updated to the new feature.

Implement these features in your wallet class under the `features` property:

```tsx
import {
  ConnectFeature,
  ConnectMethod,
  EventsFeature,
  EventsOnMethod,
  IOTAFeatures,
  IOTASignPersonalMessageMethod,
  IOTASignTransactionMethod,
  IOTASignAndExecuteTransactionMethod,
  IOTAReportTransactionEffectsMethod
} from "@iota/wallet-standard";

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
	/* ... existing code from above ... */

  get features(): ConnectFeature & EventsFeature & IOTAFeatures {
    return {
      "standard:connect": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        connect: this.#connect,
      },
      "standard:events": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        on: this.#on,
      },
			"iota:signPersonalMessage": {
        version: "1.0.0",
				signPersonalMessage: this.#signPersonalMessage,
			},
      "iota:signTransaction": {
        version: "2.0.0",
        signTransaction: this.#signTransaction,
      },
      "iota:signAndExecuteTransaction": {
        version: "2.0.0",
        signAndExecuteTransaction: this.#signAndExecuteTransactionBlock,
      },
      "iota:reportTransactionEffects": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        reportTransactionEffects: this.#reportTransactionEffects,
    };
  },

  #on: EventsOnMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's events on implementation.
  };

  #connect: ConnectMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's connect implementation
  };

	#signPersonalMessage: IOTASignPersonalMessageMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signTransaction implementation
  };

  #signTransaction: IOTASignTransactionMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signTransaction implementation
  };

  #signAndExecuteTransaction: IOTASignAndExecuteTransactionMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signAndExecuteTransaction implementation
  };

  #reportTransactionEffects: IOTAReportTransactionEffectsMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's reportTransactionEffects implementation
  };
}
```

### Exposing Accounts

The last requirement of the wallet interface is to expose an `accounts` interface. This should
expose all of the accounts that a connected dApp has access to. It can be empty prior to initiating
a connection through the `standard:connect` feature.

The accounts use the `ReadonlyWalletAccount` class to construct an account matching the
required interface.

```tsx
import { ReadonlyWalletAccount } from '@iota/wallet-standard';

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
	get accounts() {
		// Assuming we already have some internal representation of accounts:
		return someWalletAccounts.map(
			(walletAccount) =>
				// Return
				new ReadonlyWalletAccount({
					address: walletAccount.iotaAddress,
					publicKey: walletAccount.pubkey,
					// The IOTA chains that your wallet supports.
					chains: [IOTA_DEVNET_CHAIN],
					// The features that this account supports. This can be a subset of the wallet's supported features.
					// These features must exist on the wallet as well.
					features: [
						'iota:signPersonalMessage',
						'iota:signTransactionBlock',
						'iota:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock',
					],
				}),
		);
	}
}
```

### Registering in the Window

After you have a compatible interface for your wallet, use the `registerWallet`
function to register it.

```tsx
import { registerWallet } from '@iota/wallet-standard';

registerWallet(new YourWallet());
```

### Best Practices for Efficient Transaction Execution

The Wallet standard has been updated from its original design to better support changes in the IOTA ecosystem. For example, the GraphQL service was introduced after Mainnet launched. The `iota:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` feature is closely tied to the JSON RPC options and data structures, so its continued maintenance becomes increasingly difficult as the GraphQL service becomes more ubiquitous.

Consequently, the Wallet standard introduced the `iota:signAndExecuteTransaction` feature. The features of this method are more useful, regardless of which API you use to execute transactions. This usefulness comes at the expense
of flexibility in what `iota:signAndExecuteTransaction` returns.

To solve this problem, use the `iota:signTransaction` feature to sign transactions, and
leave transaction execution to the dApp. The dApp can query for additional data during
execution using whichever API it chooses. This is consistent with the default `@iota/dapp-kit` uses for the `useSignAndExecuteTransaction` hook, and enables dApps to take
advantage of read-after-write consistency when interacting with the Full-node based JSON RPC.

The downside of this strategy is that wallets often use different RPC nodes than the dApp,
and might not have indexed the previous transaction when executing multiple transactions in rapid
succession. This leads to building transactions using stale data that fail upon execution.

To mitigate this, wallets can use the `iota:reportTransactionEffects` feature so that dApps can report
the effects of transactions to the wallet. Transaction effects contain the updated versions and
digests of any objects that a transaction uses or creates. By caching these values, wallets can build
transactions without needing to resolve the most recent versions through an API call.

The `@iota/iota/transaction` SDK exports the `SerialTransactionExecutor` class, which you can use
to build transactions using an object cache. The class has a method to update its internal cache using the
effects of a transaction.

Using the combination of `iota:signTransaction` and `iota:reportTransactionEffects`, dApps can use
either API to execute transactions and query for any data the API exposes. The dApp can then report the effects of the transaction to the wallet, and the wallet can then execute transactions without running into issues caused by a lagging indexer.

## Managing Wallets

The Wallet standard includes features to help your apps interact with wallets.

### Wallet Data

To query the installed wallets in a user's browser, use the `get` function of `getWallets`.

```tsx
import { getWallets } from "@iota/wallet-standard"; 

const availableWallets = getWallets().get();
```

The return from this call (`availableWallets` in the previous code) is an array of `Wallet` types.

Use the `Wallet.icon` and `Wallet.name` attributes to display the wallet details on your web page.

The `Wallet.accounts` is an array of `WalletAccount`s. Each `WalletAccount` type has `address` and `publicKey` properties, which are most useful during development. This data fills and caches after connection.

### Features

Both the `Wallet` type and the `WalletAccount` type have a property called `features`. The main wallet functionality is found here. The mandatory features that wallets must implement are listed in the previous code.

Many wallets choose to omit some non-mandatory features or add some custom features, so be sure to check the relevant wallet documentation if you intend to integrate a specific wallet.

### Connecting a Wallet

Connecting in the context of a wallet refers to a user that joins the web site for the first time and has to choose the wallet and addresses to use.

The feature that provides this functionality is called `standard:connect`. To connect using this feature, make the following call:

```tsx
wallet.features['standard:connect'].connect() // connect call
```

This call results in the wallet opening a pop-up dialog for the user to continue the connection process.

### Disconnecting a Wallet

Similar to the connecting feature, the Wallet standard also includes `standard:disconnect`. The following example calls this feature:

```tsx
wallet.features['standard:disconnect'].disconnect();
```

### Transactions - Suggested Approach

Upon wallet connection, your app has the necessary information to execute transactions, such as address and method.

Construct the transaction separately with the `@iota/iota` library and then sign it with the private key of the user. Use the `iota:signTransaction` feature to achieve this:

```tsx
wallet.features[iota:signTransaction].singTransaction(<Transaction>, <WalletAccount>);
```

Similar to connections, this process opens a pop-up dialog for the user to either accept or decline the transaction. Upon accepting, the function returns an object in the form `{bytes: String, signature: Uint8Array}`. The `bytes` value is the `b64` encoding of the transaction and the `signature` value is the transaction signature.

To execute the transaction, use `IOTAClient` from `@iota/iota`:

```tsx
const client: IOTAClient
client.executeTransactionBlock({
    transactionBlock: bytes,
    signature: signature,
    options: {}
})
```

Your app then sends the transaction effects back to the wallet, which reports results to the user. The wallet expects the effects to be `b64` encoded.

```tsx
wallet.features['iota:reportTransactionEffects'].reportTransactionEffects(
    effects: Array.isArray(transactionResponse.effects) ? toB64(
        Uint8Array.from(transactionResponse.effects) : transactionResponse.effects,
        account: wallet.accounts[0], // for example
        chain: wallet.chains[0]
    )
```

### Transactions - Abbreviated Approach

Many wallets abstract the above flow into one feature: `iota:signAndExecuteTransaction`. The required arguments for this feature are the raw transaction and the options with the desired information to be included in the response:

- `showEffects`: Include the transaction effects.
- `showEvents`: Include the transaction events.
- `showObjectChanges`: Include all the objects that were deleted, created, or mutated.
- `showBalanceChanges`: Include any coin transfer that took place.
- `showInput`: Include the transaction's input.
- `showRawInput`: Same as `showInput` but the format is raw.

### Events Wallets Emit

The wallet emits events on certain user actions that apps can listen to. These events allow your app to be responsive to user actions on their wallets.

The wallet standard only defines the change event that can apply to chains, features, or accounts.

- `chains`: A change event on the chains means the user switched the wallet's active network, such as from Devnet to Testnet.
- `features`: The user added or removed permission for your app to access certain wallet features.
- `accounts`: The user added or removed an account (address) to interact with your app.

To subscribe your apps to events with the following call:

```tsx
const unsubscribe = wallet.features['standard:events'].on ('change', callback);
```

This call returns a function that can be called to unsubscribe from listening to the events.

The callback is the handler that contains the logic to perform when the event fires. The input to the callback function is an object with the following type:

```tsx
{
    accounts: WalletAccount[],
    chains: IdentifierArray,
    features: IdentifierRecord<unknown>
}
```

These values are all arrays containing the new or changed items. Consequently, every event populates only one array in most cases, the rest are empty.

### Implementation Example

IOTA offers a bare bones scaffold for React-based applications called `@iota/dapp-kit`. See the [dApp Kit documentation](../../references/ts-sdk/dapp-kit/index.mdx) for more information.
