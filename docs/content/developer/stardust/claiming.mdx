# Claiming Stardust Assets

<MigrationWarning/ >

As detailed in the [Stardust Move Models](move-models.mdx), Stardust assets are represented as Move objects within the ledger. Claiming these assets involves enabling original owners to utilize a [Programmable Transaction Block](../iota-101/transactions/ptb/prog-txn-blocks.mdx) to "unlock" assets such as IOTA, Shimmer, custom [`Coin`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-coin)s, or even `Alias` and `Nft` objects.

This process takes advantage of Move's unique features to ensure that assets are transferred and unlocked securely and efficiently to their rightful owners.

## Output Types to Move Objects

Stardust assets come in the form of Outputs, and each Output can be of a different type. 
To understand how Outputs have been transformed into Move Objects based on their types,
please refer to the [Stardust Move Models](move-models.mdx#summary) page.
Below, you will find one or more examples of claiming each Output type.

## Examples of Stardust Asset Claim Transactions

Here are some examples of transactions for claiming Stardust assets.
Different commands in a [PTB](../iota-101/transactions/ptb/prog-txn-blocks.mdx) are used depending on the claiming scenario,
which varies based on the Stardust Output type and composition.

### Basic Output

Go to [Basic Output](claiming/basic.mdx).

### Nft Output

Go to [Nft Output](claiming/nft.mdx).

### Alias Output

Go to [Alias Output](claiming/alias.mdx).

### Foundry Output

Go to [Foundry Output](claiming/foundry.mdx).

### Output Unlockable by an Alias/Nft Address

Go to [Output Unlockable by an Alias/Nft Address](claiming/address-unlock-condition.mdx).

## Sponsoring Your Shimmer Claiming

If some assets are owned by a Shimmer address that holds no IOTA tokens (needed to pay for gas),
the claiming process can benefit from self-sponsorship.
This means that an address owning IOTA tokens can be used by the same user to sponsor a transaction claiming Shimmer assets.

Go to [Self-sponsor Shimmer Claims](claiming/self-sponsor.mdx).
