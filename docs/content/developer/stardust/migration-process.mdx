:::note Edge Cases

This guide doesn't describe every possible edge case. 
For that, please check out the code,
which is part of a subdirectory in the [`iota-genesis-builder`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-genesis-builder/src/stardust) crate. 
This document will give a high to mid-level overview of the migration process.

:::

## Design Principles

- The migration aims to move away from the Stardust-based ledger concepts and transform assets into their pure object-based Move representation. After completing the migration flow, users should see Move assets that semantically resemble the former Stardust assets in their wallet.
- Stardust Assets on the legacy ledger level are encapsulated in Outputs. An asset is semantically a valuable resource, while an output is a container with spending rules that holds the valuable resource.
- We aim to mimic this hierarchy between assets and their containers in the genesis Move ledger state, ensuring that spending conditions still hold. Once the containers are unlocked and destroyed during a user-initiated claiming/migration transaction, the encapsulated assets will be extracted and sent to the user address, and the Move containers will be destroyed.
- We intentionally do not include constructors in Move for such containers, as we want to discourage their use after the migration. They will only be created in the genesis ledger state via the migration script.

## Foundry Outputs & Native Tokens

[Foundry Outputs](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/main/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#foundry-output) in Stardust represent the capability to control the supply of user-defined Native Tokens. In Move, there
are established ways for these operations, in particular using
[`Coin`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-coin) and
[`TreasuryCap`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-treasurycap). The two main goals of the
foundry migration are to convert it to a [`CoinManager`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin_manager.mdx),
a type introduced in the Move IOTA framework simplify working with the `TreasuryCap`, and to a `Coin<IOTA>`
to hold the IOTA tokens of the foundry itself.

A unique coin type, `Coin<XYZ>,` is represented by the one-time witness `XYZ` defined in its own package. Therefore, a
corresponding package must be created for each foundry defining the native token's one-time witness and initial minting
operations. To that end, a
[move package template](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-genesis-builder/src/stardust/native_token/package_template/sources/native_token_template.move)
is populated with the native token's metadata, e.g., its symbol, circulating supply, and description, as well as any other
metadata.

To collect this metadata, the foundry output's IRC-30 Metadata is extracted. In most cases, this is possible.
However, for example, if the metadata does not follow the IRC-30 standard or the symbol of the token is not a valid Move
identifier (e.g., containing UTF-8 characters), a random identifier for the token package is generated, and the metadata
uses generic defaults. As much as possible, though, the migration attempts to do as little modification to the UTXO as
possible. The package template is filled with the extracted data, compiled, and published.

The result of the foundry migration is the following:

- A package representing the native token, particularly containing a one-time witness representing the unique type of
the native token (to be used as `Coin<package_id::token_name::NativeTokenOneTimeWitness>`; abbreviated in the rest of
this document).
- A `CoinManager` and [`CoinManagerTreasuryCap`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin_manager.mdx#resource-coinmanagertreasurycap) object, the latter of which is owned by the address of the alias that
owned the original foundry.
- A minted coin (`Coin<NativeTokenOneTimeWitness>`) containing the entire circulating supply of the native tokens owned
by the `0x0` address.
- A gas coin (`Coin<IOTA>`) containing the migrated IOTA tokens of the foundry, owned by the address of the alias that
owned the original foundry.

After this process, the minted coin sits on the `0x0` address with the entire minted supply. When other output types are
migrated that contain a balance of _this_ native token, that balance is split off of the minted coin into a new
`Coin` object, which is then owned by the migrated output. If, by the end of this process, a non-zero balance remains on
the minted coin, it is left at the zero address. This means they were burned in Stardust and, therefore, are effectively
also burned on the Move ledger, as no one controls the `0x0` address.

In Move, the `TreasuryCap` type uses a `u64` representation (within
[`Balance`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/balance.mdx#struct-balance)) as its maximum supply. Since
Stardust allows for `u256` to be used, in some rare cases, the maximum or circulating supply may exceed the maximum
value representable by `u64` (`MAX_U64_SUPPLY`, which here refers to `2^64 - 2` for technical reasons). If the maximum
supply exceeds it, it is truncated to `MAX_U64_SUPPLY`, which is fine since no more than `MAX_U64_SUPPLY` tokens were
actually minted (the circulating supply). However, if the circulating supply exceeds `MAX_U64_SUPPLY`, simply truncating
would cause problems in the migration, since there would not be enough minted supply to distribute. In this case, all
migrated tokens are multiplied by `MAX_U64_SUPPLY / stardust_circulating_supply`, which means they are adjusted
proportionally to fit within the maximum supply of `MAX_U64_SUPPLY`. This maintains the token ratio of the Native Token
in Stardust with the `TreasuryCap` constraints. Note that in cases where the ratio is very small, this might result in a
Native Token balance of 0.

## Output Migration Design

Outputs that are not foundries are migrated using a common pattern. Their Move smart contract has a function called
`extract_assets`, which returns all the migrated assets. Generally, these outputs are migrated to an object that
contains the other associated assets in static or dynamic fields. Those assets can be the `Coin<IOTA>`,
`Coin<NativeTokenOneTimeWitness>` or another object. In particular, Native Tokens are stored in a `Bag` where the token
is behind a key of its own name (`<package_id>::<token_name>::NativeTokenOneTimeWitness`) and the stored value is of
type `Balance<NativeTokenOneTimeWitness>`. If an output owns multiple native tokens, the bag contains multiple keys.

The extraction function enforces that any potentially present unlock conditions, like `Timelock`, `Expiration` or
`Storage Deposit Return` are enforced. For instance, if a time-locked basic output's assets are attempted to be
extracted, the transaction would fail, just like it would in Stardust.

Address Ownership is migrated directly by converting `Ed25519 Address`, `Alias Address`, or `Nft Address` to an
`IotaAddress` without any modification. For `Ed25519 Address`es, their original backing keypair can simply continue to
be used to unlock objects in Move. The `Alias` and `Nft` address types represent object ownership. Those are effectively
migrated as a transfer. For example, an `Alias Output A` owning a `Basic Output B` in Stardust is migrated as setting
the `owner` of `B` to the address of `A` (the Alias ID), which is equivalent to the Alias Address in Stardust. This is
the same as if `B` would have been transferred (using either of `iota::transfer::{transfer,public_transfer}`) to the
address of `A` (the Alias ID). The migrated alias `A` can then _receive_ `B` using the
`stardust::address_unlock_condition::unlock_alias_address_owned_basic` function, which is essentially a wrapper around
[`iota::transfer::receive`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/transfer.mdx#function-receive). There are
equivalent unlock functions for the other possible variants of object ownership.

## Basic Outputs

Every Basic Output has an `Address Unlock` and some `coin` balance (`u64`). Depending on what other fields it has,
different objects are created. The most common case is that any output without special unlock conditions (or an expired
`Timelock`) is migrated to a `Coin<IOTA>` object which can be directly used as a gas object.

The migrated objects are owned by the address in the Stardust output's `Address Unlock Condition`, except when an
`Expiration Unlock Condition` is present, in which case the object is a _shared_ one.

A special case is vesting reward outputs, that is, those Basic Outputs whose `OutputId` begins with
`0xb191c4bc825ac6983789e50545d5ef07a1d293a98ad974fc9498cb18` and whose `Timelock` is still locked at the time of
migration. They are migrated to `Timelock<Balance<IOTA>>` and contain the label
`00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010cf::stardust_upgrade_label::STARDUST_UPGRADE_LABEL` by
which they can be identified as vesting reward objects.

The full decision graph (without the vesting reward output case) is depicted here (with `coin` being `IOTA`):

## Alias Outputs

Alias Outputs are migrated to two Move objects:

- `AliasOutput` object, containing the `Balance<IOTA>` and a `Bag` of native tokens in a static field.
- `Alias` object that is owned by `AliasOutput` in a dynamic object field.

Other noteworthy points:

- The `AliasOutput` is owned by the address in the Stardust output's `Governor Address Unlock Condition`. There is no
concept of a state controller on the Move side, and so the `State Controller` address from Stardust is functionally
discarded, although it can be accessed in the `Alias` object.
- The `AliasOutput` object has a freshly generated `UID` while the `Alias` has its `UID` set to the `Alias ID` of the
Stardust output. If the `Alias ID` was zeroed in the Stardust output, it is computed according to the protocol rules
from [TIP-18](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/main/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md) and then set. Hence, no `Alias` object in Move has a zeroed
`UID`.
- The Foundry Counter in Stardust is used to give foundries a unique ID. The Foundry ID is the concatenation of
`Address || Serial Number || Token Scheme Type`. In Move the foundries are represented by unique packages that define
the corresponding Coin Type (a one-time witness) of the Native Token. Because the foundry counter can no longer be
enforced to be incremented when a new package is deployed, which defines a native token and is owned by that Alias,
the Foundry Counter becomes meaningless. Hence, it is not migrated and has no equivalent field in Move. The same count
can be determined (off-chain) by counting the number of `TreasuryCap`s the Alias owns. The Stardust constraint that
foundries can only be owned by aliases is no longer enforced in the Move version.

## NFT Outputs

Much like Alias Outputs, NFT Outputs are migrated to two Move objects:

- `NftOutput` object, containing the `Balance<IOTA>` and a `Bag` of native tokens in a static field.
- `Nft` object that is owned by `NftOutput` in a dynamic object field.

Other noteworthy points:

- The `NftOutput` is owned by the address in the Stardust output's `Address Unlock Condition` or if an
`Expiration Unlock Condition` is present, by either of the two addresses in that unlock condition.
- The `NftOutput` object has a freshly generated `UID` while the `Nft` has its `UID` set to the `Nft ID` of the Stardust
output. If the `Nft ID` was zeroed in the Stardust output, it is computed according to the protocol rules from
[TIP-18](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/main/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md) and then set. Hence, no `Nft` object in Move has a zeroed `UID`.
- The `Nft` Move object contains an `Irc27Metadata` object. It is extracted from the immutable metadata of the Stardust
NFT, if possible. If the Stardust NFT does not have valid IRC-27 metadata, it is migrated on a best-effort basis.

You can examine the `convert_immutable_metadata` function in the migration code for more details.
