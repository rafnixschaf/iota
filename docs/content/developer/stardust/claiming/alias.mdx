# Claiming Alias Outputs

<MigrationWarning/ >

An address can own `AliasOutput` objects only if it was set as the Alias Governor Address before the migration. 
In this case, the `AliasOutput` object is an owned object in the ledger, and its owner is the Governor address.
This address can be directly controlled by a user or by another object (either an `Alias` or `Nft` object).
For the latter use case,
check the [`Claiming an Output Unlockable by an Alias/Nft Address`](address-unlock-condition.mdx) example.

## Claim an Alias Output

A Governor address can claim the `AliasOutput` assets at any time:

### 1. Fetch the `AliasOutput`

The first step is to fetch the `AliasOutput` object that needs to be claimed.

### 2. Check the Native Token Balance

Next, check the native tokens that might be held by this output. A [`Bag`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/bag.mdx) is used for holding these tokens. In this step, we are interested in obtaining the dynamic field keys that are bag indexes. For native tokens, the keys are strings representing the [`OTW`](../../iota-101/move-overview/one-time-witness.mdx) used for the native token declaration.

### 3. Create the PTB

Finally, create a [Programmable Transaction Block (PTB)](../../iota-101/transactions/ptb/building-ptb.mdx) 
using the `alias_output_object_ref` as input along with the native token keys. 
An `AliasOutput` differs from an `NftOutput` or a `BasicOutput` because it contains the `Alias` object.
The main purpose of claiming is to extract the `Alias` object from the `AliasOutput`.

## Convert an Alias Output into a Custom Object

To convert an `Alias` into a new entity usable for your project, 
you need to have a custom package prepared with the necessary logic.

In Stardust, an alias can serve various purposes, such as acting as an NFT collection controller.
The following example outlines the process of converting a Stardust `Alias` into a `CollectionControllerCap`.

This example extends the one described in the [Conversion of an Nft Output into a Custom Nft](nft.mdx#converting-an-nft-output-into-a-custom-nft) documentation:

The `collection.move` module extends the `custom_nft` package to enable working with NFT collections:

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/custom_nft/sources/collection.move
```

Also, the `nft.move` module was extended with the following function:

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/custom_nft/sources/nft.move#L82-L97
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Once the package is prepared, you can extract and use a Stardust `Alias` in a single transaction to create a `CollectionControllerCap`. This capability is then used in later transactions to manage new collections.
