# Claiming Basic Outputs

<MigrationWarning/ >

:::info Claiming might not be needed

Most basic outputs have no special unlock conditions and don't need to be claimed. They will simply be available as normal `Coin<IOTA>` objects for your account with no further action required. Manual claiming is only needed if special unlock conditions like unexpired timelocks apply.

:::

As a user, you may own `BasicOutput` objects that need to be unlocked before you can claim them. This guide walks you through the process of evaluating the unlock conditions for a `BasicOutput` and the steps to claim the associated assets.

## Assessing Unlock Conditions

To begin, you need to determine if your `BasicOutput` can be unlocked. You can achieve this by performing specific off-chain queries that will check the unlock conditions for the `BasicOutput`.

## Claim a Basic Output

Once you've confirmed that the `BasicOutput` can be unlocked, you can start the process of claiming its assets.

### 1. Retrieve the `BasicOutput`

The first step is to fetch the `BasicOutput` object that you intend to claim.

### 2. Check the Native Token Balance
  
After fetching the `BasicOutput`, you need to check for any native tokens that might be stored within it. 
These tokens are typically stored in a [`Bag`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/bag.mdx). 
You'll need to obtain the dynamic field keys used as bag indexes to access the native tokens.
For native tokens,
these keys are strings representing the [`OTW`](../../iota-101/move-overview/one-time-witness.mdx) used for the native token [`Coin`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-coin).

### 3. Construct the PTB

Finally, you can create a Programmable Transaction Block (PTB) using the `basic_output` as an input,
along with the `Bag` keys to iterate over the extracted native tokens.
