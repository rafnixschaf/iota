# Self-Sponsoring Shimmer Assets Claims

<MigrationWarning/ >

If you own Shimmer assets but don't have any IOTA coins to cover transaction fees, 
self-sponsorship can help you claim those assets.
In this process, a sponsor (an IOTA address) pays the transaction gas fees for another address (the user).
When claiming assets, a sponsor can cover the gas fees required for the transaction.

This is particularly useful for Shimmer assets because the Move objects derived from Shimmer Stardust Outputs don't contain IOTA coins.
As a result, addresses holding these objects lack the IOTA coins necessary to pay for gas.

## Claim a Shimmer Basic Output with Self-Sponsorship

### 1. Identify the Self-Sponsoring Address

Shimmer uses a different `coin_type` (4219) than IOTA (4218).
To find the self-sponsoring address, use the IOTA `coin_type`.

### 2. Create the PTB for Claiming

Next, create a [Programmable Transaction Block (PTB)](../../iota-101/transactions/ptb/building-ptb.mdx)
to claim a `BasicOutput` owned by the derived Shimmer address.
This process is similar to the one outlined in the [Basic Output](basic.mdx) guide.

### 3. Sign the Transaction

For this transaction, both the sender address (the object's owner) and the sponsor address must sign the transaction.
