# Connect to an IOTA Network

## IOTA CLI

IOTA provides the [IOTA command line interface (CLI)](/references/cli/client.mdx) to interact with [IOTA networks](#iota-networks), it does the following and more:

- Create and manage your private keys
- Call and publish Move modules
- Compile and test Move modules
- Create and execute programmable transaction blocks ([PTBs](/references/cli/ptb.mdx))
- Interact with testnet/devnet faucets

You can use the [CLI](iota-environment.mdx#iota-cli) or [SDKs](iota-environment.mdx#iota-sdks) to send transactions and
read requests from using the [JSON-RPC](../../references/iota-api/json-rpc-format.mdx) and the following
endpoint: `https://fullnode.<IOTA-NETWORK-VERSION>.iota.io:443`.

<AlphaNet />

## Environment Set Up

First, [Install IOTA](iota-install.mdx). After you install IOTA, [request IOTA test tokens](get-coins.mdx) for the
network you are using. If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from
your [local faucet](local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet).

To check whether IOTA is already installed, run the following command:

```shell
which iota
```

If IOTA is installed, the command returns the path to the IOTA binary. If IOTA is not installed, it
returns `iota not found`.

:::tip Release Info;

See the [IOTA Releases](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/releases) page to view the changes in each IOTA release.

## Connect Your CLI to a Network

You can connect to an IOTA network using the following command that will start
the [IOTA CLI Client](../../references/cli/client.mdx):

```bash
iota client
```

### First Run

If this is the first time you run the command, you will be prompted to configure the client.

#### 1. Create `client.yaml`

```
Config file ["<FILE-PATH>/.iota/iota_config/client.yaml"] doesn't exist, do you want to connect to a IOTA Full node server [y/N]?
```

Enter `y` to proceed. You receive the following response:

#### 2. Select the Network

```
IOTA Full node server URL (Defaults to IOTA Devnet if not specified) :
```

If you want to connect to the [Devnet](#devnet), you can simply press `Enter`.

<AlphaNet />

If not, specify your desired node URL. If you choose to add a custom URL, you should also add an alias for ease of
access:

```bash
Environment alias for [<URL-ENTERED>] :
```

#### 3. Generate Keys and Address

```
Select key scheme to generate keypair (0 for ed25519, 1 for secp256k1, 2: for secp256r1):
```

Finally, you will be prompted to select the key scheme you want to use. After this, you will receive a message that
states the selected key-scheme, the generated address and your secret recovery phrase.

:::tip Signature scheme selection

If you are unsure which scheme to use just go with the default ed25519 scheme (option 0).

:::

```bash
Generated new keypair for address with scheme "ed25519" [0xb9c83a8b40d3263c9ba40d551514fbac1f8c12e98a4005a0dac072d3549c2442]
Secret Recovery Phrase : [hat become demise beyond history wood stage add nice list jaguar legend]
```

## Add a Network Environment

The [IOTA CLI Client](../../references/cli/client.mdx) allows you to add any number of network environments.

### Check the Current Network ENVs

You can easily check the currently configured environments using the following command, which will output the
environment `alias` and URL, as well as indicate the currently active environment:

```bash
iota client envs
```

The command outputs the available environment aliases, with `(active)` denoting the currently active network.
```sh
localnet => http://0.0.0.0:9000 (active)
alphanet => https://api.iota-rebased-alphanet.iota.cafe:443
```

<AlphaNet />

You can add a new environment using the `iota client new` command. You should specify and `alias` and `rpc` URL, for
example:

```bash
client new-env --alias local --rpc http://0.0.0.0:9000
```

### Switch Network Environment

You can switch the current environment using the following command:

```bash
iota client switch --env <EnvAlias>
```

* Where `<EnvAlias>` is one of your currently set environments.
  You can use the following networks to develop on IOTA. If you are still developing your application, you should use the
  Devnet or Testnet, as these networks provide convenient faucets for test tokens.

## IOTA Networks

### Alphanet

A temporary network while still in early development, used before public launch of IOTA Rebased. Will be replaced by the Testnet afterwards.

<AlphaNet />

### Devnet

The latest stable release. As such, it has the latest features that were tested in the `development` branch of the
repository.

### Testnet

Once a release has been battle-tested in the Devnet, it moves to the Testnet. You can use this network to
test your software in real-world conditions.

<DataWipe />

:::info Testnet node validators

The IOTA Alphanet, Testnet and Devnet networks consist of four validator nodes operated by the IOTA Foundation.

:::

### Mainnet

The fully operational production network, with data persistence and where tokens have real value.


:::tip Local Networks

You can also spin up a [local IOTA network](local-network.mdx) for local development.
