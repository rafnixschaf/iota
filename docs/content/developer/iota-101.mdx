title: IOTA 101
description: Collection of core IOTA concepts that developers use to create objects and interact with them on the IOTA blockchain. 
---

In many education systems, 101-level classes are those that teach core competencies to build a foundation for the more advanced topics that are to come. The topics in this section provide the same experience for the IOTA blockchain. They examine the core IOTA development concepts that you use to build apps on IOTA. As you start developing more advanced solutions, knowledge of these topics provides a good base for understanding the more advanced concepts you will employ.

## Creating coins and NFTs on IOTA

Everything on the IOTA blockchain is an object. These topics use code examples to demonstrate how to create these specific types of objects. 

- [Create Coins](iota-101/create-coin/create-coin.mdx)
- [Create NFTs](iota-101/nft/create-nft.mdx)

## Working with PTBs

You can create programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) on IOTA to perform multiple commands in a single transaction. The Working with PTBs topics demonstrate how to build efficient PTBs using the IOTA TypeScript SDK.

Go to [Working with PTBs](iota-101/transactions/ptb/working-with-ptbs.mdx).

## Using Events

You can emit events from your published packages on the IOTA network. Using Events demonstrates how to emit events from your on-chain packages and monitor the activity of other objects emitting events.

Go to [Using Events](iota-101/using-events.mdx).

## Shared versus Owned Objects

Objects on IOTA, unlike other blockchains, can be owned as well as shared. You can create transactions that leverage either type or both. Shared versus Owned Objects examines the differences and what considerations you should account for when deciding how to structure your on-chain app. 

Go to [Shared versus Owned Objects](iota-101/objects/shared-owned.mdx).

## Access On-Chain Time

IOTA provides a `Clock` module you can use to get network-based time. Access On-Chain Time examines the `Clock` module and the behavior of the available methods that affect transaction processing speed and the temporal exactness of the data you receive.

Go to [Access On-Chain Time](iota-101/access-time.mdx).
