# Challenge 3: MintCoin Mechanics

In this challenge, you'll dive into the mechanics of "MintCoin," a [coin](../standards/coin.mdx) that allows anyone to mint new tokens using a "Proof of Move" process. However, minting alone will not be enough to get the flag—you'll need to go a step further.

Your goal is to understand how the system works and figure out the extra steps needed to successfully retrieve the flag.

This challenge's main contract is written using the Coin Standard. Having been familiar with the [Object Model](../iota-101/objects/object-model.mdx) from the last challenge, you should now be able to understand the Coin Standard and how it works.

:::tip
Your starting point should be the function `get_flag` in the `mint` module to understand the steps required to capture the flag. To successfully complete the challenge, make sure to follow the contract's logic and requirements.

Good luck in capturing your third flag!
