title: Transaction Authentication
description: Transaction security is arguably the most important feature of a blockchain. IOTA provides multiple features to secure your transactions, whether on chain or off.

Transaction authentication features on IOTA provide security against unauthorized access to on-chain data. 

## Keys and Addresses 

IOTA adheres to widely accepted wallet specifications in the cryptocurrency industry, including BIP-32 (and its variation, SLIP-0010), BIP-44, and BIP-39, to facilitate key management for users. At present, IOTA supports pure Ed25519, ECDSA Secp256k1, ECDSA Secp256r1, and multisig for signed transactions. 

Go to [Keys and Addresses](transaction-auth/keys-addresses.mdx).

## Signatures

Cryptographic agility is core to IOTA. The system supports multiple cryptography algorithms and primitives and can switch between them rapidly. With IOTA, you can choose the right cryptography solution for your system and implement the latest algorithms as they become available. 

Go to [Signatures](transaction-auth/signatures.mdx).

## Multisig

IOTA supports multi-signature (multisig) transactions, which require multiple keys for authorization rather than a single, one-key signature. 

Go to [Multisig](transaction-auth/multisig.mdx).

## Offline Signing

IOTA supports offline signing, which is signing transactions using a device not connected to a IOTA network, or in a wallet implemented in a different programming language without relying on the IOTA key store. 

Go to [Offline Signing](transaction-auth/offline-signing.mdx).

## Intent Signing

In IOTA, an intent is a compact struct that serves as the domain separator for a message that a signature commits to. The data that the signature commits to is an intent message. All signatures in IOTA must commit to an intent message, instead of the message itself. 

Go to [Intent Signing](transaction-auth/intent-signing.mdx).
