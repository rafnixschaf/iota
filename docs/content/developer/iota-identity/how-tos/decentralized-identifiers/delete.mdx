There are two approaches to delete an IOTA Identity, with different implications:

-   [Deactivate](#deactivate)
-   [Destroy](#destroy)

## Deactivate

As detailed in the [IOTA DID Method Specification](../../../../references/iota-identity/iota-did-method-spec.mdx#deactivate),
a controller of an IOTA Identity may [deactivate](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-document-metadata) it by executing an update that either:

-   deletes the contents of the DID Document entirely, leaving the state metadata empty, OR
-   sets the `deactivated` field in the DID Document metadata to `true`.

In both cases, the DID Document will be marked as `deactivated` when resolved.

:::tip Reversible

The identity can be reactivated at any time, by publishing an update restoring the DID Document's contents,
or unsetting the `deactivated` field in the metadata respectively, depending on how it was initially deactivated.

:::

### Example

The following example demonstrates deactivating and reactivating an IOTA DID Document.

```

## Destroy

Alternatively, you can [destroy](../../../../references/iota-identity/iota-did-method-spec.mdx#destroy) an IOTA Identity permanently.

:::warning Irreversible

Destroying an IOTA Identity is permanent and irreversible.

:::

This may be achieved by a DID controller by executing the `Identity::execute_delete` API.

Any coins and tokens owned by the destroyed `Identity` are reclaimed and must be sent to another address.

:::warning

Note that historical versions may still be stored off-ledger, or on a permanode,
so sensitive or Personal Identifiable Information (PII) should NEVER be stored in a DID Document.

:::

Even with a previous version available, a destroyed DID can never be restored.

### Example

The following example demonstrates how a controller destroys an IOTA Identity.
