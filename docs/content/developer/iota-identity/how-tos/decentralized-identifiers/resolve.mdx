DID resolution is the process of fetching and decoding a [DID Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) corresponding to a given [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers).
The [IOTA Identity framework](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs) supports resolving DID Documents that are
stored on an IOTA network and enables users to plug in handlers for additional methods.

This is similar to, but not to be confused with,
the [W3C DID Resolution specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/),
which defines function signatures for resolution in the context of web or REST APIs,
whereas the IOTA Identity framework provides strongly-typed resolution for a better developer experience.

This functionality is primarily provided by the `Resolver`, which can:

-   [Resolve IOTA DID Documents](#resolving-an-iota-did).
-   [Resolve DID Documents from multiple DID methods](#resolving-multiple-did-methods).
-   Resolve the DID Documents referenced in a verifiable presentation or credential.

## Resolving an IOTA DID

The following examples demonstrate how to resolve an IOTA DID Document from its DID.

### Resolver

Once you have configured a `Resolver` with a `Client`, it will resolve
IOTA DID Documents according to the read procedure defined in the [IOTA DID Method Specification](../../../../references/iota-identity/iota-did-method-spec.mdx#read).
It fetches the the `Identity` from the network specified in the DID (see [DID Format](../../../../references/iota-identity/iota-did-method-spec.mdx#did-format)),
then extracts and validates the DID Document from it.

use identity_iota::prelude::Resolver;

  // create new client to interact with chain and get funded account with keys
  let storage = get_memstorage()?;
  let identity_client = get_client_and_create_account(&storage).await?;
  // create new DID document and publish it
  let (document, _) = create_kinesis_did_document(&identity_client, &storage).await?;

  let did = document.id().clone();

  // We will be using a `Resolver` to resolve the DID Document.
  let mut resolver = Resolver::<IotaDocument>::new();

  // We need to register a handler that can resolve IOTA DIDs.
  // This convenience method only requires us to provide a client.
  resolver.attach_kinesis_iota_handler((*identity_client).clone());

  let resolver_document: IotaDocument = resolver.resolve(&did).await.unwrap();

  // Client and Resolver resolve to the same document.
  assert_eq!(client_document, resolver_document);

  Ok(())
}
```

const nodeUrl = 'https://api.testnet.shimmer.network/';
const client = new Client({
    primaryNode: nodeUrl,
    localPow: true,
});
const didClient = new IotaIdentityClient(client);

// Construct a resolver using the client.
const resolver = new Resolver({
    client: didClient,
});

// Resolve the given did
const did = 'did:iota:rms:0x7b48b06232b8a1e7a31c314cab1ceedb84e2e9dd2b1fae79b67eaa4595f15e47';
const document = await resolver.resolve(did);
```

### Client

You can also use the `Client` directly to resolve individual DIDs from its configured network.

use examples_kinesis::create_kinesis_did_document;
use examples_kinesis::get_client_and_create_account;
use examples_kinesis::get_memstorage;

use identity_iota::iota::IotaDocument;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()>{
  let storage = get_memstorage()?;
  let identity_client = get_client_and_create_account(&storage).await?;
  // create new DID document and publish it
  let (document, _) = create_kinesis_did_document(&identity_client, &storage).await?;

  let did = document.id().clone();

  // We can resolve a `IotaDID` to bytes via client.
  // Resolve the associated `Identity Object` and extract the DID document from it.
  let client_document: IotaDocument = identity_client.resolve_did(&did).await?;
  println!("Client resolved DID Document: {client_document:#}");
}
```

// Configure a client for the Shimmer testnet "rms".
const nodeUrl = 'https://api.testnet.shimmer.network/';
const client = new Client({
    primaryNode: nodeUrl,
    localPow: true,
});
const didClient = new IotaIdentityClient(client);

// Parse the DID and resolve its DID Document.
const did = IotaDID.parse(
    'did:iota:rms:0x7b48b06232b8a1e7a31c314cab1ceedb84e2e9dd2b1fae79b67eaa4595f15e47',
);
const document = await didClient.resolveDid(did);
```

## Advanced Resolver Configuration

You can configure the `Resolver` to support many use cases by attaching custom resolution handlers.
This enables the `Resolver` to resolve multiple DID methods, as well as customizing how
a particular DID method (such as the IOTA method) gets resolved.

This feature is mainly intended to be used together with the Resolver's convenience methods for
handling [verifiable presentations](../verifiable-presentations/create-and-validate.mdx)
and [credentials](./../../explanations/verifiable-credentials.mdx).

## Resolution for Verifiable Presentations

When validating [verifiable presentations](./../verifiable-presentations/create-and-validate.mdx), you need to
resolve the DID Documents of the [verifiable credential](./../../explanations/verifiable-credentials.mdx) issuers
and presentation holder to verify their signatures.

Resolving the necessary DID Documents is
[performed automatically when verifying presentations via the `Resolver`](../verifiable-presentations/create-and-validate.mdx#example-code)

When direct access to these DID Documents is desired, the `Resolver` also provides standalone methods to:

-   Resolve a presentation holder's DID Document.
-   Resolve the DID Documents of the issuers of the credentials in a verifiable presentation.
-   Resolve the issuer's DID Document for a given verifiable credential.
