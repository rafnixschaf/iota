# Identity Object

An Identity Object is a **shared** _Move_ object that stores a single DID Document on the network, allowing both
on-chain and off-chain actors to interact with it.

The Identity Object's unique ID is used to derive the actual DID of the DID Document it contains.

## Identity's Access Control

An `Identity` is a shared object and is thus accessible by anyone. For this reason, it is of paramount importance to 
limit the use of an `Identity`'s APIs - expecially its mutable ones - to only the intended actors.

### Controllers and `ControllerCap`

The [DID specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) defines **DID controller** as the entity allowed to make changes to
a DID document. Since an `Identity` may be viewed as a simple wrapper over a DID Document, we extend the definition of DID controller to be:
_the entity allowed to make changes to an `Identity`.
In order to allow a broader range of actors to act as an `Identity`'s controller - e.g. an `Identity` controlling another `Identity` -
a controller is identified through its **controller capability** `ControllerCap`.
A `ControllerCap` is a _Move_ object that acts as a blind token, allowing anyone who presents it to the corresponding `Identity` to access
the `Identity`'s APIs that are only invokable by its controllers.

### Voting power and threshold

When an `Identity` has more than a single controller, an access control (AC) policy for the `Identity` must be established. Such a policy is 
represented by an unsigned integer **threshold** that is established upon the `Identity`'s creation. Together with the `Identity`'s threshold, each controller
is assigned with a **voting power**, i.e. an unsigned integer that acts as a sort of _weight_ in the evaluation of an AC control policy.   

### Proposals

Whenever a controller wants to make a change to its `Identity`, a **proposal** encapsulating that change is created instead of carrying out the update
right away. In order to execute the changes contained in a `Proposal` enough controllers need to approve it. The exact number of approvals depends on 
the controllers' voting powers as well as the `Identity`'s threshold. 
`Proposal`s keep track of the approvals they receive by internally storing the sum of all approving controllers' voting powers in a field called `votes`.
A `Proposal` can only be executed after `votes` exceeds `Identity`'s threshold.
