# Staking and Rewards

IOTA uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system, where [validators](../tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx) get their
voting power from IOTA token holders who delegate their stakes to them.
When rewards are distributed at the end of each [epoch](epochs.mdx),
validators receive their [rewards](#rewards-distribution) based on their [performance](#performance)
and [commission rate](#commission-rate).
The rewards automatically increase as validators' staking pools receive new delegated stakes.

## Staking on IOTA vs. Other Blockchains

The IOTA staking mechanism has some unique features compared to other blockchains:

### Self-custodial Staking

Stakers keep their staked IOTA tokens in their own account.

### Auto-compounding Rewards

Rewards automatically reinvest due to a liquidity-pool-inspired design.

### Staking Timing

When a user stakes with a validator, their stake counts towards the validator's voting power starting from the next
epoch. Similarly, when a user withdraws their stake, it stops counting from the next epoch.

## Rewards Distribution

At the end of each [epoch](epochs.mdx), gas fees and stake subsidies are distributed among validators and stakers as
rewards. The amount of rewards a validator gets depends on:

### Performance

If a validator underperforms, other validators can report them, causing the reported validator to lose all their rewards
for that epoch.

### Commission Rate

This is the percentage a validator takes from their stakers' rewards.
For example, if a validator's commission rate is 10%, they take 10% of the rewards each epoch as new stake objects.

### Rewards Withdrawal

Validators receive rewards as regular stake objects, so they withdraw their staking rewards the same way as stakers.
Validators can call
the [`0x3::iota_system::request_withdraw_stake`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/6234ae2cc8137f3a2a34cd0aa1ac4fd5f31260e2/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-system/sources/iota_system.move#L272)
function to withdraw their stake and receive their rewards.
