# Consensus on IOTA

## Narwall and Bullshark

IOTA uses [Narwhal](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/narwhal),
and [Bullshark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05633), the high-throughput mempool and consensus engines developed by Mysten
Labs, to sequence transactions that require total ordering, synchronize transactions between validators, and
periodically checkpoint the
network's state.

[Narwhal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11827) ensures that data that was submitted for consensus is readily available,
while [Bullshark](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3548606.3559361) is in charge of generating a consensus on the
specific ordering of said data.

The IOTA consensus engine is a cutting-edge advancement in multi-proposer, high-throughput consensus algorithms. It can
achieve over 125,000 transactions per second with a two-second latency for a deployment of 50 participants. This
includes production-level cryptography, permanent storage, and a scaled-out primary-worker architecture.

The IOTA consensus engine offers significant scalability advantages in the following scenarios:

* A blockchain that has experimented with larger blocks and encountered increased latency before the execution phase.
* A blockchain with fast execution (e.g., focused on transactions or using a UTXO data model) where the mempool and
  consensus processes cannot keep up.

## Key Features

The Narwhal mempool offers:

* A high-throughput data availability engine with cryptographic proofs of data availability at
  a [primary node](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/narwhal/primary)
* A structured graph data structure for traversing information.
* A scaled architecture that splits disk I/O and networking requirements across
  several [workers](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/narwhal/worker)

## Architecture

A Narwhal instance sets up a message-passing system with a set of $3f+1$ units of stake divided among nodes. It assumes
a computationally bounded adversary that controls the network and can corrupt parties holding up to $f$ units of stake.
The validators collaborate to form a leaderless graph of transaction batches, referred to as collections in IOTA (often
called blocks in DAG-based consensus literature). This process uses mempool data with an unspecified consensus
algorithm.

The graph's _vertices_ are certified collections. Each valid collection, signed by its validator-author, must include a
round number and a certificate of availability signed by a quorum (2f+1) of validator stake. Each collection must also
contain hash pointers to a quorum of valid certificates (from validators with 2f + 1 units of stake) from the previous
round, forming the _edges_ of the graph.

Collections are formed as follows: each validator reliably broadcasts a collection for each round. Subject to specified
validity conditions, if validators with 2f + 1 stake receive a collection, they acknowledge it with a signature.
Signatures from 2f + 1 validators by stake form a certificate of availability, which is then shared and potentially
included in collections at round r + 1.

The following figure represents five rounds of constructing such a DAG (1 to 5), with validators A, B, C, and D
participating. For simplicity, each validator holds 1 unit of stake. The collections transitively acknowledged by A's
latest round in A5 are represented with solid lines in the graph.

  end;
  subgraph C;
  C5 -.-> C4 --> C3 --> C2 --> C1;
  end;
  subgraph D;
  D5 -.-> D4 -.-> D3 --> D2 --> D1;
  end;
  A5 --> B4 & C4;
  A4 --> C3 & D3;
  A3 --> B2 & C2;
  A2 --> C1 & D1;
  B5 -.-> A4 & C4;
  B4 --> C3 & D3;
  B3 --> A2 & C2;
  B2 --> C1 & D1;
  C5 -.-> A4 & B4;
  C4 --> B3 & D3;
  C3 --> A2 & B2;
  C2 --> B1 & D1;
  D5 -.-> A4 & B4;
  D4 -.-> B3 & C3;
  D3 --> A2 & B2;
  D2 --> B1 & C1;
```

## How It Works

* The graph construction enables the insertion of more transactions into the system by each authority and in each round.
* Certificates prove the data availability of each collection or block in every round.
* The contents form a DAG that can be identically traversed by each honest node.

## Dependencies

Narwhal is implemented using:

* [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)
* [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/)

Generic cryptography is implemented in [fastcrypto](https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto).

## Configuration

You can follow the instructions
on [Running Benchmarks](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/narwhal/benchmark) to conduct a fresh deployment
of IOTA Consensus Engine.

## Further Reading

Narwhal and Tusk (Danezis et al., 2021) is a consensus system that leverages directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). DAG-based
consensus has been developed over the last 30 years, with some history summarized in Wang et al. (2020). The theoretical
ancestor of Narwhal and Tusk is DAG-Rider (Keidar et al., 2021).

Narwhal and Tusk are developed in
the [asynchronous model](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-01-2019-5-31-models/). A partially synchronous
variant of Narwhal and Tusk is called Bullshark (Spiegelman et al. 2022).

Narwhal and Tusk started [as a research prototype](https://github.com/facebookresearch/narwhal) at Facebook Novi.
